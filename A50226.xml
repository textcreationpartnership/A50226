            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader</head>
            <p>THe occasion of my undertaking what is here presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was a letter which I received from a worthy person, who upon the perusal of that <hi>brief historical Account</hi> of the war with the Indians in <hi>New England,</hi> published the last summer, importuned me to write the story of the <hi>Pequot War;</hi> Taking his motion into consideration, it came into my thoughts, that it would be a service and benefit for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, if all other general troubles which have happened by the <hi>Heathen</hi> in this land, were recorded and made known; &amp; the rather, in that as to those <hi>first motions and commotions</hi> there are very few that know any thing of them. Wherefore I set my self to make enquiry into those matters, and shall for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the <hi>Reader,</hi> give him an account where and from whence I obtained, what light and information touching these <hi>Indian troubles,</hi> I have been any wayes able to arrive unto.</p>
            <p>Such Books as I had by me, that relate any thing of these affaires J have been willing to revolve. e.g. <hi>Johannes de Laet</hi> his <hi>Description of America,</hi> written in Latin; Also several of Cpt. <hi>Smith</hi> his books; And <hi>a relation of the discovery of New England,</hi> published by the President and Council of <hi>New England.</hi> Anno 1622. And the <hi>Relation or journal of the first planters in Plymouth</hi> together with several letters which some of them wrote to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> soon after their first coming into this countrey; and Mr. <hi>Winslow</hi> (then whom hardly any one that hath deserved more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently from New England) his <hi>good news from New England,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47037:3"/> published Anno 1624. which relations are in the hands of but few in this countrey, &amp; therefore I have been the larger in excerping things out of them. They are epitomized in <hi>Purchase</hi> his <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi> lib. 10. who declares that he had by him a description of the voiage made by Capt. <hi>Hanham</hi> to <hi>Sagaedehoc,</hi> and the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten journals of Mr. <hi>Raleigh Gilbert,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Harly,</hi> &amp; Capt <hi>Hobson,</hi> who were in this land before any English plantation was setled therein. I doubt not but in those scripts a more full and particular account is given, of the <hi>first concerns</hi> with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> here. But I could not come by the fight of them, nor do I know certainly whether those things are extant. I have also perused Sr. <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> narration of original undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings here. Moreover J have read a large Manuscript of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Bradfords</hi> (written with his own hand,) being expressive of what the <hi>first planters</hi> in this countrey met with, whether from the <hi>Heathen</hi> or otherwise, from the year 1620. to the year 1647. As for the <hi>Pequot troubles,</hi> the world is beholding to the industry of Mr. <hi>John Allyn</hi> of <hi>Hartford</hi> (as is in the subsequent <hi>Relation</hi> acknowledged) for what is thus made publick, respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Commotions which then happened. Only I have been willing to ad some particulars out of a <hi>manuscript narrative</hi> of the <hi>Pequot war,</hi> which I lately met with in Reverend Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venports</hi> library, as also what Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Morton</hi> (out of Mr. <hi>Bradfords</hi> manuscript) hath heretofore noted. Touching the <hi>Narragansets;</hi> I have searched the publick Records of the Colonyes, and from thence excerped the substance of what as here related, as to former troubles from them, or by their means procured. The <hi>Relation</hi> concerning <hi>Alexander</hi> and his brother <hi>Philip,</hi> wherewith this <hi>Narrative</hi> is concluded, I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the present Honourable Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi> (who succeeds his blessed Father, as in place, so in spirit) and from the faithful <hi>Secretary</hi> of that Colony. I am sensible that there is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in that which <hi>Erasmus</hi> doth (after his manner) wittily express <hi>Adeò nunc in omnes et omnia grassatur comitata furiis</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:47037:3"/> I thought it necessary to give this particular account of the Authors from whom I received my information, respecting passages insisted on. Nor shall I seek for any other <hi>Guard</hi> against those, whose <hi>Genius</hi> is to calumniate endeavours of this kind.</p>
            <p>I am not altogether ignorant of what is commonly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed, <hi>viz.</hi> That those <hi>Histories</hi> which are partly <hi>Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical</hi> are the most profitable; and that they that undertake a work of this nature, should go by the prescript of that so much celebrated verse,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quis, Quid, Ʋbi, Quibus auxiliis, Cur, Quomedò, Quandò.</hi> which I have endeavoured to remember. Nor hath that max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im been wholly forgotten, <hi>Stylus Historicus quo simplicior eo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior.</hi> And J may expect that <hi>Ingenuous Readers</hi> will act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which a Learned man in his <hi>Historica</hi> layeth down as a <hi>Theorem, Historici legantur cum moderatione et venia,</hi> h. e. <hi>cogitetur fieri non posse ut in omnibus circumstantiis sint Lyncei.</hi> J have done what I could to come at the truth, and plainly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, knowing that that is (as useth to be said) <hi>the soul and sun of History,</hi> whose property is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns the Story of the late war with the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, there are who have propounded, that some meet persons might be improved in the several <hi>Colonyes,</hi> to collect what of moment hath happened in each <hi>Colony</hi> since this war broke forth. When <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> compiled an <hi>History</hi> out of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of <hi>Socrates, Theodoret, Sozomen,</hi> it was of great use in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages, bearing the name of <hi>Historia Tripartita;</hi> if such a course as hath been intimated should be attended, and the designe fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, a <hi>Compleat History</hi> may (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.) be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed out of those collections, which J know not but that it may deserve the name of <hi>Historia Tripartita,</hi> and be no lesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to posterity, then some others have been. In the mean time, the Reader must be satisfied with what is already extant.</p>
            <p>This following <hi>Relation</hi> was written neer upon a year ago; since which a Reverend Author hath emitted a Narrative of the
<pb facs="tcp:47037:4"/> troubles which have happened by the Indians in New England, whose pains and industry doth (in my judgment) deserve acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledgment. Neverthelesse it hath been thought needfull to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this; Considering that most of the things here insisted on, are not so much as once taken notice of in that <hi>Narrative.</hi> And although the <hi>Pequot war</hi> be therein described (and that, as to the substance of the story, truely and impartially) it is not so fully done as is here to be seen. If this endeavour shall contribute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light or help in writing an <hi>History of New England,</hi> I hope they whose hearts are upon seeking out and declaring the works of God in the Generation which he cast them into, will accept of my labour, however mean and inconsiderable. I shall adde no more, but pray that the blessing of heaven may be upon undertakings of this nature.</p>

            <p>For <hi>in Anno</hi> 1602. and in the year following, some of our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men made notable discoveryes in that Land which lyeth North and by east of <hi>Virginia,</hi> between the degrees of 43. &amp; 45. Northern Latitude.</p>
            <p>Four or five years after this that noble Lord, Sr. <hi>John Popham</hi> (then Lord chief Justice) sent out a ship into these parts to make further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, who arriving at the place designed, quickly returned, and made such a report of what they had seen, as did greatly animate the Adventurers to go on with their begun undertaking; whereupon in Anno 1607.

Only Sr. <hi>Fr. Popham</hi> (son to the Lord chief Justice) sent diverse times to those coasts for trade and Fishing.</p>
            <p>As yet there was not (so far as I can learn) any disturbance from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> then the only Natives of this Land. But not long after this, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Ship-Master whose name was <hi>Hunt,</hi> being sent forth into these Coasts on the account of the Fishing trade, after he had made his dispatch and was ready to sail, (under pretence of trucking with them) enticed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians into his vessel, they in confidence of his honesty went aboard, to the number of twenty from <hi>Patuxe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> and there did he sell as many as he could of them for 20<hi>l.</hi> a man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it was known whence they came; for then the Friars in those parts took away the rest of them, that so they might nurture them in the Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The pernicious and avaritious Felony of this Ship-Master, in stealing and selling the <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as hath been expressed, laid the foundation to great <hi>troubles</hi> which did after that befall the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, especially in the <hi>North-east</hi> parts of this Land. Yea that inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and barbarous Fact was the unhappy occasion of the loss of many a mans estate and life, which the Barbarians in those beginning times did from thence seek to destroy.</p>
            <p>For when the Gentlemen Adventurers did again dispatch a vessel hither commanded by Capt. <hi>Hobson</hi> in order to erecting a Plantation and setling a Trade with the Natives here, <hi>Hunt</hi>'s forementioned scandal, had caused the Indians to contract such a mortal hatred against all men of the English Nation, that it was no small difficulty to settle any where within their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoryes, And whereas there were two Indians called <hi>Epen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47037:5"/> fell out otherwise; since being exasperated by what <hi>Hunt</hi> had done, they contrived with their Country-men how to be revenged upon the English. <hi>Manawet</hi> dyed within a short time after the ships arrival. <hi>Epenow</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly plotted to free himself out of the English hands, which he effected though with great hazard to himself and other <hi>Salvages</hi> that were his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Conspirators,</hi> which came to pass after this manner.</p>
            <p>Upon the Ships arrival, many of the Indians (some of them being <hi>Epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows</hi> kinsmen) came aboard and were kindly entertained by the Captain; at their departure they promised to return the next day, and bring some Trade with them. <hi>Epenow</hi> had not liberty granted him to go on shoar, only much discourse (and probably a contrivement for his escape) was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the other Indians in the vessel, which no body but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves could understand. The Indians returned at the time appointed with twenty <hi>Canons,</hi> but were shy of coming aboard. <hi>Epenow</hi> cunningly called to them as if if he would have them come into the vessel, to trade, and suddenly did himself leap overboard: He was no sooner in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the Indians sent a shower of arrows into the vessel, and came des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately near to the ship, and (in despight of all the English Musketiers aboard) went away with their Country-man <hi>Epenow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Diverse of the Indians were then slain by the English, and the Master of the English vessel, and several of the Company wounded by the Indians.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Captain and the whole company were discouraged, and returned to England, bringing nothing back with them but the news of their bad success, and that there was a <hi>War</hi> broke out between the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> and the <hi>Indians.</hi> The time when these troubles hapned, is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted more then the things themselves. <hi>Johannes de Laet</hi> in his <hi>descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Indiae Occidentalis,</hi> writeth that it was between the years 1608 &amp; 1615 So doth <hi>Purchase.</hi> Sr. <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> relates that he sent Capt. <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> into these parts in Anno 1614, and what <hi>Hunt</hi> did was before that, as being the Grand procuring Cause of the Broyle between the English and the Indians, which first began in that year.</p>
            <p>After these things another vessel was sent into these <hi>Northern</hi> parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Capt. <hi>Rocr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he resolved to leave them in the Wilderness, not knowing but they might haply discover something which might be advantageous.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47037:6"/>
            <p>Accordingly he furnished them with ammunition, and some victuals for their present subsistence, and turned them ashore to <hi>Sacodehock,</hi> himself with the rest of his Company departing to <hi>Virginia.</hi> Those English Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers got over to the Island of <hi>Monhegin,</hi> three leagues from the Main, where they kept themselves safe from the Fury of exasperated Indians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the next Spring, when a vessel that came on the Coast on a Fishing voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, found them all (except one person that died of sickness in this inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Not many years after this, <hi>viz.</hi> in Anno. 1619 a Gentleman whose name was <hi>Darmer</hi> was sent to prosecute the design of planting and setling a Trade in <hi>New-England,</hi> and to endeavour that a right understanding of matters between the Indians and the English might be accomplished.</p>
            <p>He therefore brought with him an Indian called <hi>Squantum,</hi> who was one of those that <hi>Hunt</hi> had treacherously carried away from <hi>Patuxet,</hi> but was bought by an English Merchant, and lived some time with Mr. <hi>Slany</hi> a Gentleman in <hi>Cornhil,</hi> until he could speak broken English, and after that at <hi>New-found-land,</hi> where Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> was then Governour, who was willing that Mr. <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mer</hi> should take <hi>Squantum</hi> with him to <hi>New-England.</hi> Upon his arrival here, he told his Countreymen very strange storyes, giving them to understand what kind usage he had met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the English where he had been, and how much the wicked Fact of that covetous <hi>Hunt</hi> was condemned, so that many of them began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with, and become friendly toward the English, and Mr <hi>Darmer</hi> conceited that he and <hi>Squantum</hi> had made a firm peace between the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But, <hi>manet alta mente repostum</hi>— Indians are not wont to forget injuries, when once they have sustained any: so did that Gentleman find it to his after sorrow: For being near the place where <hi>Hunt</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly betrayed the Indians aboard his vessel, they treacherously set upon him, and gave him fourteen wounds, so that he had much adoe to escape with his life, And though he got to <hi>Virginia</hi> after this, some write that he never recovered of those wounds which he received of the <hi>Nausit</hi> Indians. And <hi>Epenow</hi> (before mentioned) was the cause of Capt. <hi>Darmers</hi> being so assaulted, whom he hapned to meet with at his first landing in that place: The Indian being able to speak English, reported to Capt. <hi>Darmer</hi> the story of his escape out of Capt. <hi>Hobsons</hi> vessel, laughing heartily at the conceit of it. The Captain told him that Sr. <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> was much troubled that he should meet with such ill usage as to put him upon a temptation to steal away. This Salvage after some enquiries about Sr. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> (and his Family) with whom he had sometimes lived in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, belike suspecting that Captain <hi>Darmer</hi> had a purpose to surprize
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47037:6"/> him, he conspired with some of his Fellows to take the Captain, and laid hands on him, who did with his sword manfully defend himself against those barbarous and treacherous Assailants. What other particular mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs were done by the <hi>Northern Indians</hi> (or others) about this time, I cannot learn: Only Capt. <hi>Smith</hi> writeth that he met with many of their <hi>silly Encounters</hi> (as he cals them) but without any hurt. Also, a little before the first planters in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony arrived in this land, three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen belonging to Sr. <hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> were killed by these salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and two more narrowly escaped with their lives. And thus far wee have a <hi>Cold</hi> account of the design respecting the advancement of a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. A company of Christians belonging to the <hi>Northern parts of England,</hi> who proposed not so much worldly as spiritual ends in their undertaking, ayming at the <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the worship of God in purity, did therefore transport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and familyes into this Howling wilderness. The first land they made was that of <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> Novemb. 9. where they came to an Anchor, and went on shore, Novemb. 11. Perceiving the Incommodiousness of that place for planting, they resolved to seek out for another that might be more accommodate. But their Shallop not being in trimm to be sent out upon discovery, some were desirous to improve the time, in making what searches they could upon the land thereabout.</p>
            <p>Novemb. 5. Sixteen men well armed were set on shore under the conduct of Capt. <hi>Miles Standish.</hi> After they had gone about a mile near the shoar, they descryed five or six Indians, who like wild creatures ran away from them at the first sight, they followed them by the trace of their footings, about ten miles, til night came on, but could not come to any speech with them.</p>
            <p>At last they met with a kettle, wherein was Indian corn, which after much consultation they seized upon, resolving that if they could come to speak with Indians, they would return them their Kettel, and give them full satisfaction for their corn, which they intended for planting, not knowing how else to be supplyed. So did they return the next day, but lost themselves awhile in the woods, and as they were wandring up &amp; down, they hapned to espy a small tree that was bowed down, and some Acorns strewed underneath, whilst they were viewing of it, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it should mean, it gave a sudden jerk, whereby one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was caught up by the leg, it being an Indian Deer-trap; the rest loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and at last they found their way to the ship again.</p>
            <p>After this, their Shallop being fitted for the purpose, they went a coast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47037:7"/> upon discovery, but of some dayes could meet with no Indians. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they found old deserted Indian Forts, and more of their corn and baskets, and a bottle of oyle which doubtless some how was brought out of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the tenth of December, they discerned the track of Indian feet upon the sand, and followed it, till they perceived where it struck up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woods, at last they light upon an Indian path, which led them a great way up into the woods, and saw where there had been corn planted, and found Indian graves &amp;c. but no man appeared.</p>
            <p>So they returned to their Shallop, and some watching, others betook themselves to their rest. But in the night they were alarmed by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels crying <hi>Arm, Arm,</hi> supposing Indians to be near them. They heard a most hideous howling, but one in the Company perswaded the rest, that it was the noyse of wolves and Foxes, which used (as he said) to make such a noise in <hi>New-found-Land</hi> where he had been, two gunns were shot off, at which the noise ceased.</p>
            <p>But betimes in the morning, on a sudden they heard the same voices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and one of the company cryed <hi>Indians, Indians,</hi> and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrowes came pouring in upon them. This barbarous salutation was amazing to the English, but that which did most of all terrifie was the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cry of those Salvages, whose note was after this manner, <hi>Woach woach ha ha hoch woach.</hi> A stout Indian who was thought to be their Captain, standing behind a tree let fly his arrows apace, and stood three shotts of a musket, untill one took full aim at him, and (as tis supposed) sorely wounded him, upon which he gave an extraordinary shriek, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and all the other Indians fled with him. Providence so ordered, as that none of the English received any hurt, though afterwards they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up eighteen arrows, (and many more were shot at them) some whereof were headed with brass, others with Harts-horn, others with Eagles Claws, and sundry of the English had their coats shot through &amp; through.</p>
            <p>Decemb. 19. The English landed and resolved to endeavour the setling of a plantation, at that place which is now called <hi>Plymouth.</hi> No Indians there as yet appeared to give them any disturbance: Yea though some were sent out to seek after them, they could find none.</p>
            <p>There were not many dayes after this, two Englishmen who being by the side of a pond, hapned to see a Deer, and having Dogs with them, they pursued the Deer until such time as they lost themselves in the woods, where they were forced to lodge that night, and were terrified with the yelling (as it seemed to them) of two <hi>Lions,</hi> who roared exceedingly, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47037:7"/> a third that they thought was very neer them: they betook themselves to a tree, purposing if the Lions should come, to climb that for their securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but they saw none. The next day they perceived that Indians had made fires thereabouts, but it was wel they met not with any until they came home, being then unarmed and not fit for encounter with such Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Now it was that a special providence of another nature hapned: For the English having built an house in <hi>Plimouth,</hi> a spark of fire flying into the thatch, it was instantly burnt down. Mr. <hi>Carver</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> were then sick, yet if they had not risen with good speed, they had been blown up with powder. The house was full of beds as they could lye one by another, and their muskets charged, yet (through the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God) no hurt done.</p>
            <p>Febr. 16. An English-man that was gone forth upon a fowling design, espyed twelve Indians marching toward the English plantation, and heard the noise of many more not far off, he lay close untill they were gone by, and then with all speed returned home and gave the alarm, but no Indians followed, only they took away the tools of those English, that had been at work in the woods.</p>
            <p>The next day two Indians presented themselves on the top of an hill; two English went out to parly with them, but they ran away, and the noise of a multitude of them was heard on the other side of the hill.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> an Indian called <hi>Samoset</hi> came boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the houses, which were newly built in <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and to their great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, spake to them in English, saying, <hi>Welcome Englishmen;</hi> This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian was a <hi>Sagamore</hi> belonging to the <hi>Northern parts,</hi> about <hi>Monhiggen,</hi> where he had often conversed with English Fishermen, and had learned to speak broken English; Hee was the first Indian that they of Plymouth had opportunity to discourse with, Hee could tel them of the <hi>Hugg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47037:8"/>
            <p>Accordingly, March 22. <hi>Massasoit</hi> with his brother <hi>Quadequina</hi> came accompanied with about sixty of his men; and an agreement of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the English and Indians was then concluded on. This peace was in more respects then one singularly advantagious to the English, whilst they were thus but few in number, and strangers in this land.</p>
            <p>And as for the reasons inducing <hi>Massasoit</hi> to this accord with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, there were several things that prevailed with him thereunto; For <hi>Squantum</hi> had told him what a great Prince King <hi>James</hi> was, and how well he would take it if his Subjects were kindly entertained, and how ill if otherwise, and how easy it was for him to send over ships and men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to destroy <hi>Massasoit</hi> and all his people. At that time also there was enmity between <hi>Massasoit,</hi> and the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> so that he hoped the English might be a defence to him against them. Thus did the feud which was kindled amongst the Indians one against another, advantage the poor Church in Plymouth. <hi>Sic Canes lingunt ulcera Lazari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover the consideration of the Guns, and other warlike Weapons, which ours brought with them, vvas terrible to the Indians, yea they had more formidable apprehensions thereof, then there vvas real cause for: They imagined that the English could by their great Guns cause the trees to fall dovvn and kill the Indians. Furthermore <hi>Squantum</hi> did wickedly possess them with one delusion about the English, which had dismal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions upon the minds of these ignorant Barbarians; For whereas the plague (a disease which was never known in this land either before or since) had newly been raging amongst them, whereby many of their towns were totally depopulated, and desolated: he made them beleive that the English kept the plague in a place under ground, and that they could let it loose upon the Indians when they would. An Indian called <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomock</hi> being one of <hi>Massasoits</hi> Counsellors, observing in one of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish houses a kind of a Cellar, where some barrels of powder were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, enquired of <hi>Squantum</hi> what that was, To whom he replyed, that there the English kept the plague that he told them of, which they could let loose upon Indians at pleasure. When this <hi>Hobbomock</hi> became acquainted with the English, he seriously asked them whether they had any such power, they answered him truly that they had not, but withall added that the God whom they served had power to send that or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disease upon those that should doe any wrong to his people. The Consideration of that also, was some terror to the Indians.</p>
            <p>In the Moneth of <hi>June</hi> 1621. The English sent Messengers with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to <hi>Massasoit</hi> at <hi>Pocanoket,</hi> By the way they were accosted with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Indians, who having them at an Advantage as they passed

            <p>Others of them were of such servile and slavish dispositions, as that they became servants to the Indians, who would hire them to work with them in making Canoos, which Canoos were intended for the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal of the English ship, in the day when they would execute their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Massacre.</p>
            <p>Some of the Theeves were stockt and whipt, yea one of them was at last put to death, to satisfie the Indians; but it was then too late.</p>
            <p>By the end of <hi>February,</hi> they had spent all their bread and corn, not leaving any for seed, nor would the Indians be induced to lend or sel them any, upon any terms, hoping they would be starved to death.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, they purposed to take away the Indians store from them by violence, and therefore made preparations accordingly.

            <p>These motions must needs cause ill blood between the Nations: so that the Indians grew very insolent in their carriage, and there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conspiracyes to cut off the English. And inasmuch as they thought that if they should destroy the <hi>

            <p>The next morning, the <hi>Sachim</hi> came accompanied with his train of salvages, saluting the Captain in such a manner as was hugely ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the English; For he put out his tongue, that one might see the root of it, and so licked the Captains hands, al his men doing the like, and endeavouring (according to the rude information they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Squantum</hi>) to make him a leg, he did perform his Ceremony after such an odd manner, as the English were hard put to it to refrain from open laughter.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47037:11"/> and how he had been the death of Christians both French and English and what pittifull weak Creatures they were, that when they were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they died crying, and made sower faces, more like children then men, and that whereas they were determined to kil the English (who had injured them) of Mr. <hi>Westons</hi> plantation, the best way for their own security was, to kill them of <hi>P ymouth</hi> too, now their Captain being in their hands, having but six men with him, two or three in the <hi>Wigwam,</hi> and no more in the shallop, it was a good opportunity to begin.</p>
            <p>The murderous Counsel of this Audacious Bloud-sucker, was highly applauded; and the Indians waited when Capt. <hi>Standish</hi> would fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, that they might attempt the bloudy Tragedy. But God so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that he could not sleep that night. Also, an Indian secretly stole some Beads from him; which when the Captain perceived, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately called his six men together, and they beset the Sachims house, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing to him that as they would not doe wrong to him, so neither would they receive any, and therefore as they valued their lives, they should forthwith restore the stolen goods. Hereupon the <hi>Sach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

However this did so daunt the courage of the treacherous and cowardly Indians, that they attempted not their designed mischief.</p>
            <p>All this while, they of Plimouth Colony had no certain knowledg of the evil that was intended against them, by the Heathen albeit the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was very strong, for the Indians at <hi>Nosset, Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The first day whilst on their journey back again, they were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with <hi>Coubatant</hi> the Sachim of <hi>Metapoyset</hi> (before mentioned) who was a politick and jocose Indian, and stil suspected to be false to the English; He asked Mr. <hi>Winslow,</hi> how they, being but two, dared to trust themselves amongst so many Indians.

            <p>So then being returned to plymouth, It was on March 23. resolved, to hearken to <hi>M ssasoit</hi> advi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47037:12"/> And considering, that there was no dealing with Indians (as other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do one with another) above board, it was thought most expedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt by policy, to catch them at unawares, as they are wont to do by others Wherefore Capt. <hi>Standish</hi> made choice of eigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e his opportunity to seyze upon the <hi>Ringleaders</hi> amongst the Conspirators.</p>
            <p>Being arrived at the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Bay, Two principal Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors behaved themselves very insolently. One of them called <hi>Picksuot,</hi> who was a <hi>Pan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at, though not speak.</hi> Likewise another Indian, and <hi>Wittawamats</hi> brother, who in bloodiness was like unto him, being present; Capt. <hi>Stan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uots</hi> knife from about his neck, and killed him with his own knife. At the same time his men fell upon <hi>Wittawamat,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indian, and slew them, and took <hi>Wittawamats</hi> brother, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him.</p>
            <p>After this they set upon another company of Indians, and killed two or three of them, seeking stil after more. At length they espied a file of Indians making towards them, but as the English came to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, they (i. e. the Indians) ran behind the trees, and shot at Capt. <hi>Standish,</hi> until one as he was shooting, had his arm broke by a bullet, from one of Capt. <hi>Standish</hi> his souldiers, whereupon he, and the rest fled into a <hi>Swamp.</hi> The Captain dared the <hi>Sachim</hi> to come out, and fight like a man, but in vain.</p>
            <p>At the time of these skirmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hes, there was an Indian youth, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the slaughter made amongst his countreymen, came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the English, desiring that he might be with them. He confessed that the Indians had resolved to cut off Mr. <hi>Westons</hi> men, and that they only stayed for the finishing of two Canoos more (which if Capt <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> had not so unexpectedly come upon them had been finished) that were intended for the surprizal of the English ship in the harbour.</p>
            <p>Also an Indian Spye, who was taken prisoner and detained at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> when he saw Cap. <hi>Standish</hi> return with <hi>Wittawamats</hi> Head, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it with a guilty, gastred countenance, and then confessed the Plot that was in hand to destroy the English, and that <hi>Picksuot</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47037:12"/>
               <hi>Wittawamat,</hi> together with three <hi>Powaws,</hi> were the principal Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators. He was released, and sent to <hi>Oktakiest,</hi> the Sachim of the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sachusets,</hi> to signify what he must look for, in case he should continue in hostility against the English. The Sachim being amazed, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the English successes, humbly begged for peace, pretending that he could not keep his men in order, and that it was against his will that evil had been done to, or designed against the English.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the effect of these things was, that the rest of the Indians were stricken with such terror, and dread of the English, that they left their houses, and betook themselves to live in unhealthfull <hi>Swamps,</hi> wherby they became subject to miserable diseases, that proved mortal to multitudes of them. Particularly, <hi>Kunacum</hi> Sachim of <hi>Manomet, Aspinet</hi> Sachim of <hi>Nosset, Janowgh</hi> Sachim of <hi>Mattachiest,</hi> these all fell sick &amp; died. This last Sachim said, that <hi>the God of the English was offended at the Indians, and would destroy them in his anger.</hi> And these signal appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of God for his <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> must needs be a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to the Heathen. Howbeit these motions ended in the subversion and ruine of Mr. <hi>Westons</hi> plantation; God who determines the bounds of mens habitations, having appointed, that another people out of <hi>England</hi> should come afterward, and possess that place, as at this day.</p>
            <p>And thus far is Mr. <hi>Winslows</hi> Relation of these <hi>first Troubles</hi> by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in these parts, which I take to be undoubted verity: For he was one that had particular knowledge of those things, and a man of truth, and conscience, that would not for the world willingly falsify in any particular.</p>
            <p>There is an old <hi>Planter</hi> yet living in this countrey, being one of those that were employed by Mr. <hi>Weston,</hi> who also hath given some account of these matters.</p>
            <p>He doth relate, and affirm, that at his first coming into this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the English were in a very distressed condition, by reason of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and sickness which was amongst them, whereof many were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dead; and that they buried them in the night, that the Indians might not perceive how low they were brought.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Relator</hi> doth moreover declare, that an Indian <hi>Panies,</hi> who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly purposed bloody destruction against the English, and made it his design to learn the English tongue, to the end he might more readily accomplish his hellish devices, told him, that there had been a French vessel cast away upon these coasts, only they saved their lives and their goods, and that the Indians took their goods from them, and made the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> their servants, and that they wept very much, when
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47037:13"/> Indians parted them from one another, that they made them eat such meat as they gave their dogs. Only one of them having a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he provided a Wife for him, by whom he had a Son, and lived longer then the rest of the French men did; and that one of them was wont to read much in a Book (some say it was the New-Testament) and that the Indians enquiring of him what his Book said, he told them it did intimate, that there was a people like French men that would come into the Country, and drive out the Indians, and that they were now afraid that the English were the people of whose coming the French man had foretold them. And that another ship from <hi>France</hi> came into the <hi>Massachusets Bay</hi> with Goods to Truck, and that Indian <hi>Panies</hi> propounded to the Sachim, that if he would hearken to him, they would obtain all the French mens Goods for nothing, namely, by coming a multitude of them aboard the vessel, with great store of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, making as if they would Truck, &amp; that they should come without Bows and arrows, only should have knives hid in the flappets which the Indians wear about their loins, and when he should give the <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word,</hi> they should run their knives into the French mens bellyes, which was accordingly executed by the Indians, and all the French men kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, only Mounsier <hi>Finch</hi> the Master of the vessel being wounded, ran down into the Hold, whereupon they promised him that if he would come up, they would not kill him, notwithstanding which, they brake their word, and murdered him also, and at last set the ship on Fire.</p>
            <p>Some enquiring of him how long it was since the Indians first saw a ship, he replyed that he could not tel, but some old Indians reported, that the first ship seemed to them to be a Floating Island, wrapped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the roots of trees, and broken off from the Land, which with their <hi>Canoos</hi> they went to see, but when they found men there and heard gunns, they hasted to the shore again not a little amazed. (Some write that they shot arrows at the first ship they saw thinking to kill it)</p>
            <p>This <hi>Relator</hi> doth also affirm, that after jealousies began between the English of Mr. <hi>Westons</hi> plantation and the Indians, they built diverse of their <hi>Wigwam:</hi> at the end of a great Swamp, near to the English, that they might the more suddenly and effectually doe what was secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived in their heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and an Indian Squaw said to them that ere long <hi>Aberkiest</hi> would bring many Indians that would kill all the English there and at <hi>Pa uxet.</hi> After which the <hi>Sachim</hi> with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his men came armed towards them, and bringing them within the Pale of the English Plantation, he made a speech to the English with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47037:13"/> great gravity saying, <q rend="inline">When you first came into this land, I was your friend, we gave gifts to one another. I let you have land as much as we agreed for, and now I would know of you if I or my men have done you any wrong.</q> Unto whom the English replyed, that they desired, that he would first declare whether they had injured him.</p>
            <p>The Sachim roundly rejoyned, that either some or all of them had been abusive to him; for they had stolen away his corn, and though he had given them notice of it times without number, yet there was no satisfaction nor reformation attained.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the English took the principal <hi>Thief</hi> and bound him and delivered him to the <hi>Sachim,</hi> with all declaring, that he might do with him what he pleased. Nay (said he) Sachims do justice themselves upon their own men, and let their neighbours do justice upon theirs, otherwise we conclude that they are all agreed, and then fight.</p>
            <p>Now the Indians some of them began to tremble, and beholding the Guns which were mounted on the English Fort, they said one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (in their Language) that little guns would shoot through houses, and great guns would break down trees, and make them fall and kill Indians round about. So did they depart at that time dissatisfied and enraged.</p>
            <p>The English now perceiving that the Indians were fully purposed to be revenged on them, they resolved to fight it out to the last man.</p>
            <p>As they were marching out of the Fort, seven or eight men stood stil. saying, this is the second time that the Salvages had demanded the life of him that had wronged them, and therefore they would have him first put to death, and if that would not satisfy, then to fight it out to the last, wherefore he was put to death in the sight of the Heathen; after which the English marched out towards them, but they dispersed themselves into the woods.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Relator</hi> endeavoured to give notice to them in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> how that the Indians had contrived their ruin, but he missed his way between <hi>Weymouth</hi> and <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and it was wel he did so; for by that means, he escaped the savage hands of those Indians, who immediately pursued him, with a murderous intention Ere he could reach <hi>Plymouth,</hi> they were informed by <hi>Massasoit</hi> (as hath been declared) concerning what was plotted amongst the Indians.</p>
            <p>Finally there were (as this <hi>Relator</hi> testifieth) three several skirmishes with the Indians. One at <hi>Wesegusquaset,</hi> before mentioned; another at a place where the town of <hi>Dorchester</hi> is since planted; and lastly at the Bay of <hi>Agawam</hi> or <hi>Ipswich;</hi> in all which engagements, the Indians
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47037:14"/> were notably beaten, and the English received no considerable damage, so that the Sachims entreated for peace, nor were the English, (provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it might be upon terms safe and honourable) averse thereunto, <hi>Pacem te poscimus omnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These dark clouds being thus comfortably dispelled, and blown o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the <hi>first Planters</hi> in this Country received no considerable distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from the Indians a long time. It is true, that soon upon these motions, (viz. in August, Anno 1623.) a Gentleman arrived here out of <hi>England</hi> (namely Capt. <hi>Robert Gorges</hi>) being attended, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny servants, as purposing the settlement of an English plantation in this Bay of <hi>Massachusets;</hi> and although that plantation was quickly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and dissolved, other things, and not any anoyance from the Natives here caused those designs to prove abortive.</p>
            <p>The like is to be affirmed concerning Mr. <hi>Wollastons</hi> plantation. For whereas he with several others, being persons of quality, did (in the year 1625) with a multitude of servants come into this <hi>Massachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets Bay,</hi> as intending to settle a plantation therein, they met with such cross providences as did discourage them, and at last dissipate them, yet nothing from the Indians.</p>
            <p>I have been informed, that this Gentleman considering the unhappy <hi>Catastrophe's</hi> attending Mr. <hi>Weston</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gorges,</hi> their plantings at <hi>Wesegusquaset,</hi> conceited that the Indian <hi>Powaws</hi> had brought that place under some fascination, and that Englishmen would never thrive upon <hi>Enchanted ground,</hi> and therefore they would pitch down their stakes in a place nearer to <hi>Boston;</hi> even where the town of <hi>Brantree</hi> hath since flourished; but the difficultyes of a Wilderness were too hard for them, that Mr. <hi>Wollaston</hi> removed a great part of his servants to <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> not having (so far as I can understand) received any molestation from the Indians here.</p>
            <p>In Anno 1628. Mr. <hi>Endecot</hi> (who deserves to be honourably menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as having been a <hi>Patriot</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>) arrived here with a <hi>Patent</hi> for the Government of the <hi>Massachusets.</hi> He and others with him sat down at a place called <hi>Nahumkeik</hi> (as in a Parenthesis let me here observe, that that Indian word is also Hebrew, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Nahum</hi> signifieth <hi>Consolation,</hi> &amp; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>keik</hi> is hebrew for a <hi>Boosome,</hi> or haven, and it so fals out, that the English have hapned to call that place by another name which is also Hebrew, viz. <hi>Salem</hi>) There did they enjoy <hi>Peace.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there are Antient Planters, who testifie that the Indians being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with some fears lest the English should in time take their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47037:14"/> from them, were conspiring to destroy them. And the small handfull of Christians then in <hi>Salem,</hi> were alarmd with the report of no less then a thousand Barbarous Natives, coming to cut them off, and that upon a Lords day, whereupon they discharged several great guns, the small shot wherein made such a terrible ratling amongst the trees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, that the amazed Indians returned not a little affrighted. And it was a wonderfull providence of God, now to restrain the Heathen, since it so hapned that about this time there were some Tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the English themselves. For whereas Mr. <hi>Wollaston</hi> and his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners left some of their servants here, and gave order that a man whose name was <hi>Filcher,</hi> should command and oversee them. There was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other whose name was <hi>Thomas Morton,</hi> he would needs take upon him to be <hi>Lord of Mis-rule,</hi> and having gained much by trading with the <hi>Indians,</hi> this <hi>Morton</hi> and his drunken Companions quickly wasted all in riotous living.</p>
            <p>This was the man that taught the Indians in these parts <hi>the use of Guns,</hi> how they should charge and discharge them, and imployed them in Hunting for him: And when they were instructed in the use of these instruments of death, they would purchase them at any rates, whereby the safety of the English was not a little hazzarded.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the English at <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Salem,</hi> agreed to seyze upon this <hi>Morton,</hi> which was done <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> and he was sent over to <hi>England,</hi> there to receive such punishment as by the honourable Council for <hi>New-England</hi> should be thought meet.</p>
            <p>All these tumults notwithstanding, the over-ruling providence of God kept the Indians quiet.</p>
            <p>It is to be wondred at, that the Church in <hi>Plymouth</hi> should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served when other English Plantations could not subsist in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but either the Indians, or the Lords own hand brought them to a sudden end from time to time. But God who saw that they designed something better then the world, in their planting here, brought it to pass by such wayes as these,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Massasoit</hi> (as was hinted before) was perswaded by <hi>Squantums</hi> information, that if the English should be his friends, he need not fear any enemies in the World; so did he become a wall to the English at Plymouth against other Indians. The Earth helped the woman that was fled into the Wilderness, whom the Dragon would have swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord made them very succesfull in their expeditions against those enemies that first sought their destruction.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47037:15"/>
            <p n="3">3. They prevailed with God by Fasting and Prayer to look upon them and bless them with special mercy when it was a time of need, which did greatly affect and astonish the Indians: some of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conceiving high thoughts concerning the English mans God, and his love to his people, that truly fear and serve him. That which Mr <hi>Winslow</hi> (and since him another) doth publickly testifie concerning this matter, deserveth Commemoration, namely, that whereas after the <hi>First Indian Troubles</hi> were over, there was a sore drought on the land continuing for the space of six Weeks, insomuch that it was judged by some that the corn was withered and dead, past recovery, the <hi>Church in Plymouth</hi> set themselves by Fasting and Prayer, to seek mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Lord in this thing. And although in the morning when they assembled themselves, the heavens were clear, and the drought as likely to continue as ever, yet before their solemn Exercise was ended, the heavens grew black with clouds, and the next morning these clouds distilled rain, and for the space of fourteen dayes together there were moderate showers, so that the drooping corn was revived to admi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>A friendly Indian, before mentioned, known by the name of <hi>Hobbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock,</hi> living in the town of Plymouth, enquired why the English met together in that manner, it being but three dayes after the Sabbath; and being informed of the true cause thereof, and observing the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects that followed, he was greatly affected, and told other Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of it, who were also smitten with deep conviction, and the more in that, albeit in times of Drought the Indians are wont to <hi>Powaw</hi> and cry to their gods, sometimes for many dayes together, yet if rain follow, it is wont to be accompanied with terrible Thundring and Lightning and tempests, which often do more hurt then the rain doth good: whenas it was otherwise with respect to the showers which at this time came from Heaven, in answer to the Prayers of the Church in Plymouth, So that the Heathen confessed that the English mans God was better then theirs. And some amongst the Indians became faithfull to the English, though as yet but a very few,</p>
            <q>Apparent rari Nantes in Gurgite vasto.</q>
            <p>There having been (as was said) a <hi>Patent</hi> for the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by royal Grant obtained, many out of England flocked into this Country almost every year. And for the most part, not so much on the account of Trade, or to prosecute any worldly interest, as on the account of Religion. These did God own, having wonderfully made way for their planting here by casting out the Heathen before them,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47037:15"/> with mortal Diseases, especially by the <hi>Plague</hi> amongst the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, and the <hi>Small Pox</hi> among the <hi>Massachusets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anno, 1631. New jealousies arose concerning the treacherous Indians. Capt. <hi>Walker</hi> one evening had two arrows shot through his Coat, which caused an Alarm at <hi>Lyn,</hi> then known by the name of <hi>Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust:</hi> but no lives were lost, nor is there any certainty to this day who shot those arrows, whereby the Captains life was so eminently endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered.</p>
            <p>About the same time the Indians began to be quarrelsome touching the bounds of the Land which they had sold to the English; but God ended the controversy by sending the small pox amongst the Indians at <hi>Saugust,</hi> who were before that time exceeding numerous; whole towns of them were swept away, in some of them not so much as one Soul es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping the destruction. There are some old Planters surviving to this day, who helped to bury the dead Indians, even whole familyes of them all dead at once. In one of the <hi>Wigwams</hi> they found a poor infant sucking at the breast of the dead mother, all the other Indians being dead also.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, when the town of <hi>Ipswich</hi> was first planted, it was vehemently suspected that the Tarratines (or eastern Indians) had a design to cut off the English there. For a friendly Indian called <hi>Robin</hi> came to an Englishman whose name is <hi>Perkins,</hi> acquainting him that such a Thursday there would come four Indians to draw him to the water side under pretence of trucking with him, and that they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared forty <hi>Canooes</hi> which should ly out of sight under the brow of an hill, full of armed Indians to cut off the English. The four Indians came at the time, and to the person mentioned, He instead of going to the water side to truck with them, spoke roughly to them, and caused an Alarm, so they immediately returned, perceiving their Plot was discovered, and presently fourty such Canooes as the friendly Indian had given warning of, were discovered.</p>
            <p>Besides the Particulars which have been insisted on, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that there was any general disquietment raised by the Indians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the year 1636. It is true that some particular mischiefs and private Murthers were committed before that, after the forementioned trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And two yeares after that, Mr. <hi>John Oldham</hi> was massacred by the Indians of <hi>Munisses,</hi> now called <hi>Block-Island;</hi> which things made way for the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In or about the year 1633. One Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> arrived in the <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chusets,</hi> in a ship from <hi>Virginia,</hi> who sometime after was bound for <hi>Virginia</hi> again, in a smal Bark, with one Capt. <hi>Norton,</hi> who sailing up Connecticut River, about two leagues from the entrance, cast An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor; there coming to them several Indians belonging to that place, whom the <hi>Pequotts</hi> tyranized over, being a potent and a warlike peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they being accustomed so to deal with their neighbouring Indians. Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> having some occasion with the Dutch, who lived at a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding house, near twenty leagues up the River, procured some of those Indians to go as Pilots with two of his men to the Dutch; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47037:16"/> benighted, before they could come to their desired port, put the Skiffe, in which they went, ashore; where the two Englishmen falling asleep, were both murdered by their Indian guides, there remaining with the Bark, about twelve of the aforesaid Indians, who had in all probability, formerly plotted their bloody designe, and waiting an opportunity when some of the English were on shore, and Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> asleep in his Cabbin, set upon them and cruelly murthered every one of them, and plundered what they pleased, and afterward sunk the Bark.</p>
                        <p>These Indians were not native <hi>Pequots,</hi> but had frequent recourse to them, to whom they tendered some of those goods, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the chief Sachem of the <hi>Pequots:</hi> and some of the Goods were tendered to the Sachim of <hi>Niantick</hi> who also received them.</p>
                        <p>The Honoured Council of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> hearing of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>Pequots,</hi> sent to speak with them, &amp; had some Treatyes, but no issue was made to satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>After which, Capt. <hi>John Endicot</hi> was sent forth Commander in chief, with Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhill,</hi> Capt. <hi>Turner</hi> and about an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men, who were firstly designed against a people living on <hi>Block-Island,</hi> who were subjects to the <hi>Narraganset Sachem,</hi> they having taken a Barke of Mr. <hi>John Oldam,</hi> murthering him and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. They were also to call the <hi>Pequots</hi> to an account about the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Capt. <hi>Stone:</hi> who arriving at <hi>Pequod,</hi> had some Conference with them, but little was effected, only one <hi>Indian</hi> slain, and some <hi>Wigwams</hi> burnt.</p>
                        <p>After which the <hi>Pequots</hi> grew enraged against the English who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited <hi>Connecticut,</hi> being but a small number, about two hundred &amp; fifty who were there newly arrived, as also about twenty men at <hi>Sey-Brook</hi> under the command of Leiut. <hi>Lion. Gardner,</hi> who was there placed by several Lords and Gentlemen in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Pequots</hi> observing Lieut. Gardner going to fire the Meadows about half a mile off the Fort, with ten men with him, was violently assaulted by the <hi>Pequod Indians,</hi> so that some were slain, the rest were rescued by the Souldiers issuing out of the Fort upon the said <hi>Pequots</hi> who fled. They also seized some that were passing up <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and tortured them in most cruel manner, with most barbarous and inhumane crueltyes; roasting of them alive &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>They also lay sculking about the Fort almost constantly, that the English could not go out of the Fort, but they were assaulted by the <hi>pequods,</hi> so that <hi>Connecticut</hi> out of their small numbers, constrained
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47037:17"/> themselves to send Capt. <hi>John Mason</hi> with twenty men to secure the place. But after his coming, there did not one <hi>Pequod</hi> appear in view for a moneths space about the Fort, which was the time he there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.</p>
                        <p>In the interim, many of the <hi>Pequods</hi> went to a place now called <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersfield</hi> on <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and having confederated with the Indians of that place (as it was generally thought) they lay in ambush for the English people of that place, and diverse of them going to their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in a large field adjoyning to the town, were set upon by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, nine of the English were slain upon the place, and some horses, and two young women were taken Captive.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Pequoas</hi> at their return from Wethersfield, came down to the River of Connecticut, (Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> then being at <hi>Saybrook</hi> Fort) in three or more Canooes, with about an hundred men, the English es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying of them, concluded they had been acting some mischief against us, and therefore prepared one of their great Gunns, and made a shot at them, which shot strook off the head of one of their Canooes wherein the two Captives were, al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hough the shot was made at them at a great distance, near three miles: but seing it was so placed, they hastned to the shore, and drew their Canooes with what speed they could over a narrow Beach and so got away.</p>
                        <p>The English of <hi>Connecticut</hi> being so alarmed by these insolencyes of the <hi>Pequods,</hi> saw meet to call a Court, which met in <hi>Hartford</hi> upon <hi>Connecticut</hi> the first day of May 1637. who seriously considering their condition, which did look very sad, since the <hi>Pequods</hi> were a great people, fortified, cruel, warlike, munitioned &amp;c. and the English but an handfull in comparison of them. But their outragious violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the English (having murthered about thirty of them) their great pride and insolency, and their constant pursuit in their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courses, with their endeavours to ingage other Indians in their Quarrel against the English, who had not offered them the least wrong,</p>
                        <p>These things being duly considered, with the eminent hazzard and great perill the people of <hi>Connecticut</hi> were in, it pleased God so to stir up the hearts of all men in general, &amp; the Court of <hi>Connecticut</hi> in special, that they concluded it necessary that some Forces should be sent forth speedily, against the <hi>Pequots,</hi> their grounds being just, and necessity enforcing them to engage in an offensive and defensive War, the management of which Warr, with the good success the Most High was pleased to crown his people withall, we are nextly to relate.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IN the beginning of May, 1637. there were sent out by Connecticut Colony ninety men, under the command of Capt. <hi>John Mason</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Major <hi>Mason,</hi> and Deputy Governour of Connecticut Colony) against the <hi>Pequots,</hi> with whom went <hi>Ʋncas</hi> an Indian Sachem of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heag</hi> who was newly revolted from the <hi>Pequots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This small <hi>Army</hi> was shipped in one Pink, one Pinnace &amp; one Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, some of which vessels in their passage down Connecticut River, fell on ground, by reason of the lowness of the water, and the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the English in the channel. The Indians not being wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to such things with their small Canooes, and also being impatient of all delayes, desired they might be set on shore, promising they would meet our Army at <hi>Seybrook;</hi> which request of theirs was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and they being set at liberty hastning to their Quarters at <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> met with about thirty or fourty of the <hi>Pequots</hi> near <hi>Seybrook,</hi> and ingaged them, and slew seven of them upon the place, and had only one of their own wounded, who was conveyed back to <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> in a Skiffe.</p>
                        <p>Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhill</hi> hearing of the approach of the Army, went &amp; met them and informed them what was performed by <hi>Ʋncus</hi> and his men, which news was welcome to them, and looked upon as a special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; for before they were somewhat doubtfull of the fidelity of their Indian Volunteers.</p>
                        <p>Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhill</hi> hearing of the design our Army was upon, very freely offered his Service with nineteen men to go along with them, if Leiut. <hi>Gardner</hi> would allow of it (who was chief Commander at Seybrook Fort) which motion was no sooner propounded to Lieut. <hi>Gardner,</hi> but he readily approved of it, and our Councill of War ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of it also; who in liew of those twenty, immediately sent back
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47037:18"/> twenty of theirs to Connecticut to help guard the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Upon a wednesday our Army arrived at Seybrook, where they lay wind-bound till Friday, in which time the Councill of War consulted how and in what manner they should proceed in their Enterprize, which was accompanied with much difficulty; their Commission order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to land their men in the <hi>Pequit</hi> River, against which were these difficultyes.</p>
                        <p>First. The <hi>Pequods</hi> kept a continual Guard upon the River, night and day in a constant course.</p>
                        <p>Secondly. Their numbers far exceeded ours; they had also sixteen gunns with powder and shot, besides their Indian Artilery, as our Councill of War was informed by the two captive maids (mentioned where we declared the Grounds of this War) who were redeemed by the Dutch, and restored now to us at Seybrook, which was a very friendly office, and not to be forgotten.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly. They were on Land, and being swift of foot, might much impede the landing of our men, and dishearten them, they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guarding that River, and our men not knowing where to land nearer then <hi>Narraganset.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly. It was alledged that if our Army landed at Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganset, they would come upon their Backs, and possibly might sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them unawares; at worst they should be on firm Land as well as the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding these reasons, the Councill of Warr, all of them except the Captain, were at a stand, and could not judg it meet to sail to <hi>Narraganset.</hi> Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> in this difficult case, went to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Samuel Stone,</hi> late Teacher to the Church of Christ at <hi>Hartford,</hi> who was sent as Preacher to the Army, and desired him that he would that night commend their case and difficultyes before the Lord, and seek direction of him in the matter, how and in what manner they should demean themselves. He retired himself from them aboard the Pink the remaining part of that day, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night was not wanting in spreading the case before the Lord, and seeking his direction, in the morning he came on shore to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains chamber, and told him he had done as he desired him, (and though formerly he had been against sailing to <hi>Narraganset</hi> and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, yet now he was fully satisfied to attend it.</p>
                        <p>The Councel being again called, and the matter debated, &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons considered, they agreed all with one accord to sail to <hi>Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi>
                           <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47037:18"/> which the next morning they put in execution, which proved very succesfull, as the sequel may evidently demonstrate. What shall I say? God led his people through manifold Difficultyes and Turnings, yet by more then an ordinary hand of Providence, <hi>He led them in a right way.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On Friday morning, they in pursuance of their design set sail for <hi>Narraganset Bay,</hi> and on Saturday toward evening they arrived at their desired Port, where they kept the Sabbath.</p>
                        <p>On Munday the wind blew so hard at Norwest that they could not go on shoar, as also on Tuesday till it was near Sunset, but the wind abating, they and their design being commended to God by Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> and his Company landed, and marched up to the place of the chief Sachims residence, and told him, that they had not an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity before, to acquaint him with their coming armed into his countrey, yet they hoped it would be wel accepted by him, there being amity between us and them, and also that the <hi>Pequots</hi> and they were enemies, and that he could not be unacquainted with those intolerable wrongs and injuries, those <hi>Pequots</hi> had lately done unto the English, and that they were now come (God assisting) to avenge ourselves upon them, and that they did only desire free passage through his countrey.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Sachim</hi> returned this Answer, that he did accept of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and did also approve of their designe, only he thought our numbers were too weak to deal with the enemy, who were (as he said) very great Captains, and men skilful in war, thus he spake somewhat slightingly of our men.</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday morning they marched from thence, to a place called <hi>Niantick,</hi> it being about eighteen, or twenty miles, distant, where another of those <hi>Narraganset</hi> Sachims lived in a Fort, it being a frontier to the <hi>Pequots.</hi> They carried it very proudly to our men, not permitting any of them to come into their fort.</p>
                        <p>Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> beholding their carriage, and knowing the falshood of the Indians, fearing lest they might discover them to the enemy, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Indians having many times some of their neer relations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their greatest Foes, saw cause to set a guard about their fort that no Indian might pass in or out, and charged the Indians not to pass out upon the peril of their lives. And there they Quartered that night, the Indians not offering to stir out all the while.</p>
                        <p>In the morning came to the Army several of <hi>Miantinomie</hi> his men, who told them they were come to assist them in the expedition, which encouraged diverse Indians of that place to engage also, who drawing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47037:19"/> into a ring, one by one, made solemn protestation how gallantly they would demean themselves, and how many men they would kill.</p>
                        <p>On Thursday, about eight of the Clock in the morning, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thence towards <hi>Pequot,</hi> having about <hi>five hundred Indians</hi> with them. In which march, through the heat of the weather, and want of provision, some of our men fainted; but when they had marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve miles, they came to <hi>Pawqatuck</hi> River to a Foord, where the Indians said the Pequots did usually fish. There they made a stand and stayed some small time; but the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Indians manifested great fear, and many of them returned, although they had despised our men, and said they durst not look upon a <hi>Pequot,</hi> and vaunted what great things they themselves would do.</p>
                        <p>Capt. <hi>John Mason</hi> saw reason then to acquaint the Indians that they were come on purpose, and were resolved (God assisting) to see the <hi>Pequots,</hi> and to fight with them before they returned, although they perished; and then he enquired of <hi>Ʋncas</hi> what he thought the Indians would do; who said the Narragansets would all leave them, but as for himself, he would never leave them, and so it proved.</p>
                        <p>After they had there refreshed themselves with their mean Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they marched about three miles, and came to a field which had been planted with Indian corn, where they made another Alt: and supposing that they drew neer to the enemy, who, as they were informed, had two forts almost impregnable, which did no ways dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the souldiers, but rather animated them, insomuch that they resolved to assault both the forts at once; but the Council of War ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving consulted the matter, understood that one of the forts, in which the bloodiest Sachim resided, was so remote that they could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly come up with it in season, and seeing some of the souldiers spent in the march with extream heat, and want of necessaries, concluded and resolved to assault, and storm the nearest fort.</p>
                        <p>Then they <hi>marched</hi> on in a <hi>silent manner;</hi> The Indians that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who in the march hitherto kept the Van, (being surprised with great fear) fell all into the Reer. They continued their March till about an hour in the night, &amp; then coming to a little Swamp between two hills, there they pitched their little Camp, being much wearied with hard travell; supposing (by the Relations of the <hi>Indians</hi>) they were near the Fort, which proved otherwise. The rocks were their pillows, yet rest was sweet and pleasant to them. The night proved comfortable being clear and Moonlight. They appointed their Guards, and placed their Sentinels at some distance, who heard their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47037:19"/> enemies, singing in their Fort until midnight, with great insulting and rejoycing (as they were afterwards informed by <hi>Wequash</hi> a <hi>Pequot</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who was revolted from the Pequots, and was one of their Guides in this march) For they seeing our pinnaces sail by them a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded they were afraid of them, and durst not to come near them.</p>
                        <p>Towards morning Captain <hi>Mason</hi> being awakened, and seeing it very light, supposed it had been day, and so they might have lost their opportunity, having determined to make their assault before day and therefore immediately roused up his Souldiers, and briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended themselves and Designe to the guidance and Protection of the Lord, and went to the assault.</p>
                        <p>Their Indian Guide shewing them a path said it led directly to the Fort; they took the path, and marched on the best part of two miles, wondering that they saw not the Fort; and fearing that their Indian Guide might delude them; but coming to a place where corn was newly planted at the foot of a great hill, supposed the Fort was not far off, a champion Country being round about them. There the Captain caused his Company to make a stand, and gave order that the Indians should come unto him; at length <hi>Ʋncas</hi> &amp; <hi>Wequash</hi> came up, of whom he demanded where the Fort was, they answered, on the top of that Hill: He also enquired where the rest of the Indians were; they answered behind exceedingly afraid; he then desired them to tel the rest of their fellowes that they should by no means fly, but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>nd at what distance they pleased, and see whether English men would now fight or not. Then Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhill</hi> came up into the Front, &amp; after Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> had commended their case to God (their being two entrances into the Fort, they divided their men; &amp; Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> lead up to that entrance on the North-east side, who approaching with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a rod of the entrance a dog bark'd, and an Indian cryed <hi>Wanux wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nux.</hi> He commanded his Souldiers to close up to the Fort, and fire upon them through the palizadoes, which they did, the Indians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a dead and indeed in their last sleep. The Souldiers having fired wheeled off and came to the main entrance, which was blocked up with bushes about breast high, over which Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> very couragiously leaped, and stood to make good the entrance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Souldiers to follow him, one of which endeavouring, was entangled in the bushes, but getting back, pulled out the bushes and so the Souldiers followed their Captain into the Fort with their Swords drawn; for they had concluded to destroy them with the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47037:20"/> sword, and so to save the plunder.</p>
                        <p>The Indians as yet kept their <hi>Wigwams;</hi> Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> entred a Wigwam, and his Guard not seeing him, passed away from him, where he was strongly assaulted by many Indians, but he bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himself, and slew several of his opposers; at last <hi>William Heyden</hi> perceiving the place where the Captain went in, essayed to go in himself, but in his entrance stumbled upon a dead man, but soon recovering himself, he fel upon the Indians. The Indians some were slain, some fled, others crept under their beds, where they slept their last; the Captain going out of the Wigwams met with many of them and put them to the sword; In which time of fight several English were wounded. Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> perceiving his men wounded, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my not yet routed, saw cause himself to go into a wigwam, and fetch out a firebrand, and putting it in one of the mats with which the wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams were covered, commanded one of his souldiers to throw some powder upon it, which set the mat on fire, which the wind taking; it was quickly throughly kindled, which made the Indians run as men most dreadfully amazed.</p>
                        <p>And Indeed such a dreadfull terror did the Almighty let fall upon their spirits, that they would fly from the sword, and cast themselves into the very flames, where many of them perished.</p>
                        <p>The fort being fired, the Captain commanded that all should march out of the fort, and surround it; which was readily attended by all, only one <hi>Arthur Smith</hi> was so wounded that he could not move out of the place, who was happily espyed by Leiut. <hi>Tho. Bull,</hi> and by him rescued from the flames, which otherwise had consumed him.</p>
                        <p>The fire was kindled on the <hi>Northeast</hi> side to windward, which did swiftly over run the whole Fort, to the extream amazement of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and great rejoycing of our souldiers; some of the enemy climbed to the tops of the pallizadoes, where they were shot down, others ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the windward side of the Fort, and lay pelting at our men with their arrows, who repaied them with their smal shot, others of the stoutest issued forth of the Fort, about fourty of them who fell by the sword.</p>
                        <p>Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhil</hi> and those with him acted their parts in this trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, especially one Mr. <hi>Hedge,</hi> who was the first that entred that gate to which Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhil</hi> led up; the fire was no sooner kindled but the smoke and flames were so violent, that they were constrained to desert the Fort and keep them in.</p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47037:20"/>
                        <p>Thus were they now at their wits end, who not many houres before exalted themselves in their great pride, threatning and resolving the utter ruin and destruction of all the English, exulting and rejoicing with songs and dances; but God was above them, who laughed his enemyes and the enemyes of his people to scorn, making them as a fiery oven; thus were the stout hearted spoiled, having slept their last sleep, and none of their men could find their hands; thus did the Lord judge among the heathen, filling the place with dead bodyes.</p>
                        <p>And here we may take notice of Gods judgement upon this bloody Generation, in sending the very night before the assault an hundred and fifty men from their other fort to join with this fort, who were design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as some of themselves have related) to go forth against the English at that very instant when this stroke came upon them, where the most of them perished with their fellows, so that the mischief they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against us came upon themselves; they were taken in their own snare and we through the mercy of God escaped. And thus in little more then one houres space was their Impregnable <hi>fort,</hi> with themselves utterly destroyed, to the number of <hi>five or six hundred,</hi> as hath been confessed by the <hi>Pequots</hi> who escaped. There were seven taken captive, and about <hi>eight</hi> escaped; and <hi>of the English</hi> there were <hi>two sla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

The Chyrurgion was much wanted, who was left with the Barks in Narraganset Bay, with order there to remain until the night before they intended the assault.</p>
                        <p>And thereupon grew many difficultyes amongst the Army, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision and ammunition being neer spent, and they in the enemyes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, who did far exceed them in numbers, being much enraged, and most of our Indian friends having left them, and our pinnaces at a great distance from them, and their coming uncertain.</p>
                        <p>But as they were consulting what course to take, it pleased God to discover our vessels to them under a fair Gale of wind sailing into the <hi>Pequot</hi> Harbour, to their great rejoicing.</p>
                        <p>They had no sooner discovered our vessels, but immediately came up the enemy from the other fort about three hundred of them. Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> led forth a file or two of men to skirmish with them, which stopt their Carrier, and put them to a stand, and then they prepared to march towards our vessels, but four or five of our men were so wounded that they were fain to be carried, with the Armes of about twenty more which took up so many of the souldiers, that there was not above forty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47037:21"/> men free, but at length they hired several Indians to carry the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded-men, who eased them of that burthen, and carried their woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men for them.</p>
                        <p>And when the souldiers had marched about a quarter of a mile, the enemy came to the place where the for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The souldiers then meeting with a small brook at the foot of the hil being very dry, sat down and refreshed themselves, the enemy being grown by this time so wary they durst not come too neer, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb them.</p>
                        <p>Then they marched on towards <hi>Pequot</hi> Harbour, and meeting with-several <hi>Wigwams</hi> in the way they burnt them; the enemy followed them, and some lay in ambush behind rocks and trees, often shooting at them, yet God so covered them, that not one of them was hurt, and when they came to any swamp or thicket, they made some shot, and cleared a passage, and some of the enemy fell, which our Indians see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would give a great shout, and then venture to fetch their heads, and thus they continued, till they came within two miles of Pequot Harbour, where the enemy gathered themselves together, and left our army; they marched on to the top of an hill adjoining to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, with their colours flying, (as for their Drum, it was lost, or at least left by their Drummer at the place where they kept their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouze the night before) where they saw our vessels riding at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor to their great rejoicing, and when they had marched to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter side, there they sat down in quiet.</p>
                        <p>Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> being there arrived (with our vessels) with forty men sent by the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Colony upon some service against the block-Islanders or Pequots, came to the shore in a shallop, with some of his men, as he said, to rescue our Army, supposing they had been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, although there did appear no sign of any such thing.</p>
                        <p>But Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> could not be prevailed with by any means to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture himself on shore while our wounded men were carried on board, which was troublesome, not only to our souldiers, but to his own men also, who manifested their dislike of his carriage; at length our men were fetched aboard our vessels, to the great rejoicing of their friends, where they did with one heart blesse the Lord, for his mercy &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto them.</p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47037:21"/>
                        <p>I might here relate a contest that fel out between Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhill</hi> and Capt. <hi>Patrick,</hi> about Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhil's</hi> claiming an Interest in the Bark in which Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> sailed, which by the mediation of Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> was issued, and that being the place of Randezvouze, where vessels were expected from the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> it was agreed that Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> should there ride in that Bark, and secure the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans untill our vessel could carry our wounded men to <hi>Seybrook,</hi> and our Pink return to carry home the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Indians.</p>
                        <p>After this agreement, Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhill</hi> set sail for <hi>Seybrook</hi> in our Bark, but before he was out of sight, Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> signified by writing to Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> that he could not attend that Service he had ingaged for he must with his company wait at <hi>Seybrook,</hi> for some vessels he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Bay; advising Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> seeing he had obtained the honour of that Service, he would compleat it in securing the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganset Indians, &amp;c.</hi> Which indeed was a hard task and difficult; for the Pink could not entertain them, and to march by land was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, it being near twenty miles, and in the enemies country, and their numbers being small; for they had sent home about twenty men to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In their march, about the mid-way between that and <hi>Seybrook,</hi> they fell upon a people called <hi>Nianticks,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Pequots,</hi> who fled to a swamp for refuge; but when they heard or saw this small troop they fled, who pursued them awhile by their track as long as they kept together; but the day being much spent, Sabbath drawing on, &amp; themselves much spent with their former travel, and service, they left their pursuit, and marched on towards <hi>Seybrook,</hi> and about sun-set they arrived by <hi>Connecticut</hi> River side; where they were welcomed by Lieut. <hi>Gardner,</hi> with many great Gunns, but were forced there to take up their Quarters that night. On the morrow morning they were all fetched over, where they kept the Sabbath, and were nobly entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Lievt. Gardner, from whom they received many Courtesies.</p>
                        <p>And when they had taken order for the safe conduct of the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganset</hi> Indians to their Country, Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> with his men returned to <hi>Connecticut</hi> the place of their abode, where they were entertained with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47037:22"/> great triumph, and rejoycing and praising of God, for his goodness to us in succeeding our endeavours, in crowning them with success, and in restoring our small Army with so little loss.</p>
                        <p>Thus was God seen in the mount, crushing his proud enemies, and the enemies of his people, so that they who were ere while a terror to all that were round about them, who resolved to destroy all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, and to root their very name out of this Country, were by weak meanes thus vanquished and destroyed, and the mischief they plotted, and the violence they offered, was brought upon their own heads in a moment; for the Lord burnt them up in the fire of his wrath, &amp; dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ground with their flesh, it was the Lords doing, and it is marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in our eyes. It is He that hath made His work wonderfull, and therefore ought to be remembred.</p>
                        <p>Suddenly after this, the whole Body of the remaining <hi>Pequots</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to that Fort where <hi>Sassacous</hi> the chief Sachim did reside, and charged him that he was the only cause of all their troubles that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell them, and therefore they would destroy both him and his; yet by the entreaty of his Counsellors, they spared his life; and consulting what course to take, concluded there was no abiding any longer in their Country, and so resolved to fly into several parts. The greatest body of them went towards <hi>Manadus,</hi> and in their passage over <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> River, they met with three English men in a shallop going for <hi>Seybrook,</hi> and fought them, who resisted them stoutly, and killed &amp; wounded many of them, but their shallop falling on ground, they were all three slain.</p>
                        <p>About a fortnight after our souldiers were returned home from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> Fight, we heard of the arrival of several vessels from the <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chusets Colony</hi> in Pequot River; Capt. <hi>Israel Stoughton</hi> being Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief, and with him about 120 men, who were sent by that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony to prosecute the War against the <hi>Pequots;</hi> and although the main Body of the <hi>Pequots</hi> were fled, yet some straglers remained in that Country, some of whom were discovered by the <hi>Moheags</hi> and by them discovered to the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Forces, by whom they were both sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised and taken, and several of which, to the number of about twenty three, were put to death; the rest were sent to the Bay.</p>
                        <p>The Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> hereupon sent forth Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> again with forty men, as also several Gentlemen, (as the Honour'd <hi>John Haines</hi> &amp; <hi>Roger Ludlow</hi> Esqrs.) to meet with those of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> to consult and determine what was further necessary to be attended. who meeting with those of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> in the <hi>Pequot</hi> harbour,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47037:22"/> after consultation, concluded to pursue the <hi>Pequots</hi> (who as you heard before were fled towards the <hi>Menados</hi>) and so began their march after them, and discovered several places where they had rendevowed and lodged not far distant one from the other, for they could make but little hast, by reason of their ancient people and children, and their want of provision, being forced to gather clams, and such other things as the wilderness afforded for their relief. The vessels sailed along by the shore. In the march some were gleaned, but within the space of three dayes, or thereabouts, they arrived at a place then called <hi>Quinipiag</hi> (now <hi>New-haven</hi>) and there espying a great smoke in the woods, not far distant, supposing the <hi>Pequots</hi> might be there, they went to discover them; but they quickly discovered them to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut Indians. From thence they sent a <hi>Pequot</hi> captive (whom they named <hi>Luz</hi>) upon discovery, who brought them tidings of the enemy which proved real. The <hi>Pequots</hi> were so terrified in their flight, that a <hi>Moheag</hi> Indian (named <hi>Jack Eaton</hi>) meeting in this pursuit with three <hi>Pequots,</hi> took two of them and brought them to the English.</p>
                        <p>But to return, they having tidings where the <hi>Pequots</hi> were, hastned toward the place where they heard they were, and at last coming into a corn field, several of the English espyed some Indians, who fled from them. They pursued them, and coming to the top of an hill, saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wigwams just opposite, only a swamp intervening, which was almost divided in two parts. One Serjeant <hi>Palmor</hi> hastning with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve men (who were then under his command) to surround the smaller part of the swamp that so he might prevent the Indians fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But Lievt. <hi>Davenport,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Jefferyes &amp;c.</hi> going up to the <hi>Wigwams</hi> were there assaulted by the Indians. In this Skirmish the English slew but few, two or three of themselves were wounded, the rest of their Army coming up, the swamp was surrounded.</p>
                        <p>Their Council being called, the question was propounded how they should proceed? Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> advised that they should cut down the swamp, (they having taken many Indian hatchets) Others propounded to hedge in the swamp, which others judged would be to no purpose, and therefore strongly opposed it, Some other advised to force the swamp, having time enough (it being about three a clock in the afternoon) but that being opposed, it was then propounded that the men should be drawn up close to the swamp, which would have lesned the circumference, and then to fill up the open passages with bushes, that so they might secure them till the morning, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider farther about it. But neither of those would pass, so different
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47037:23"/> were their apprehensions, which was very grievous to some, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Indians would make an escape in the night, as easily they might, &amp; did, the swamp being large and their numbers so small that they were forced to stand at a great distance one from another, which made their escape more easie.</p>
                        <p>Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> took order that the narrow passage in the swamp should be cut through, which would much shorten the leaguer, which was accordingly attended and resolutely performed by Serjeant <hi>Davis</hi> and some others with him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Stanton</hi> a man well acquainted vvith the Indians lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and manners, perceiving the Counsell of War loth to destroy Women and children, (as also the Indians of that place) freely offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his service to go into the swamp and treat with them, vvhich the Councel were somevvhat backward to, by reason of some hazard he might be exposed to, but his importunity prevailed, who going to them did in a short time come to the Councel with near 200. old men, women and Children, vvho delivered themselves to the mercy of the English, most of vvhich brought their small present with them, and laid it down before the Councell. Now night drawing on, they did beleaguer the swamp as strongly as they could.</p>
                        <p>But above halfe an hour before day the Indians that were in the swamp, attempted to break through Capt. <hi>Patricks</hi> Quarters, But were beaten back several times; they made a great noise, as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>; Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> sent Serjeant <hi>Stares</hi> to assist those against whom the Pequots pressed to come out by, at which time also Capt. <hi>Trask</hi> came in to their assistance, but the tumult encreasing, the siege was raised, and they marching up to a place at a turning of the swamp, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were forcing out upon them, but they fired upon them, and sent them back by their small shot; Then they waited a little for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond attempt, but the Indians facing about, and pressing violently u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Capt. <hi>Patricks</hi> Quarters, brake through, and so escaped about seventy of them, as the Indians informed; the swamp was searched; there were but few found slain. The Captives that were taken were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred and eighty, which were divided between the two Colonyes, and they intended to keep them as servants, but they could not endure that yoke, for few of them continued any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time with their masters.</p>

                        <p>Then they went up into the River in their vessel, but by reason of flats were forced to land on the Westside of the River, their <hi>Wigwams</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the East-side, just opposite, where they saw the Indians running up and down, jeering at them.</p>
                        <p>Then they landed, and went up into a narrow place in the River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two rocks, where they drew up the Indian Cannooes, and got suddenly over the River, sooner then they were expected, and march<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed up to the <hi>Wigwams,</hi> where the Indians were all fled, except some old people that could not</p>

                        <p>Then they drew up their Bark into a Creek the better to defend her, there being some hundreds of Indians within five miles, waiting their motions.</p>

                        <p>They then called to them, saying, they desired to speak with them, and that they would lay down their armes for that end, vvhereupon they stood up: The Captain told them that the <hi>Pequots</hi> had violated their promise and Covenant vvith the English, in that they vvere not there to inhabit, and that he vvas sent to supplant them; The Indians ansvvered, the <hi>Pequots</hi> vvere good men, their friends, and they vvould fight for them and protect them; vvhich vvords moved the Captain, vvho told them it vvas not far to the head of the creek, vvhere he vvould meet them, and then they might try vvhat they could do;

                        <p>In those ingagements some men had special deliverances.

            <p>In Anno 1636. A Vessel going from Connecticut towards the Bay, putting in at Block Island, the Indians coming aboard to trade, killed the Master. Another vessel coming from Connecticut, taken with a cross wind, intended to put in at <hi>Narraganset,</hi> but could not; being therefore forced upon <hi>Block-Island,</hi> they saw a bark with her sayls up, driving too and fro, they hailed her, but no Answer was given; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her full of Indians they suspected the English belonging to the Vessel were murdered, whereupon they discharged their guns, shooting bullets amongst the Indians, who, many of them immediately leaped overboard. The Master entred the Vessel, and lifting up a Cloth saw an Englishman dead, and discerning that many Indians were still in the hold, he returned to his own Vessel again, from thence pouring in small shot upon the Indians, for a while, until the wind coming fair; he sailed away to <hi>Boston,</hi> informing the Governour and Council there, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had seen, whence about an hundred Souldiers were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with sent to <hi>Block-Island.</hi> As they were landing, the Indians came down and shot violently at them, wounding one man, but as soon as one Englishman was landed, they ran away. The English pursued them two dayes, burning their Corn and Wigwams, but the Indians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themselves to Swamps, thereby escaping with their lives. After this they resolved for the <hi>Pequot</hi> Country, having received some Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Insolency and outrage of those Indians. As they were sailing up the River, many of the <hi>Pequots</hi> on both sides of the River cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them, desirous to know what was their end in coming thither, they were told that they desired to speak with <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It was pretended that he was not at home neither. The English went a shore, and required the Indians to deliver up those that had murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Capt. <hi>Stone,</hi> It was Answered, that they were also gone from home, but they would send after them, and deliver them to Justice, and that they might the better keep the English in parley, they said that their Sachem would presently come and treat with them. In the mean time they transported their goods, women and Children to another place.</p>
            <p>At last one of the Indians declared plainly, that <hi>Momanottuck</hi> would not come. Immediately a Skirmish followed▪ wherein one Indian was killed, and an English man was wounded. The Indians fled, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish pursuing, set fire to their Wigwams, and destroyed their Corn, so did they return to their Vessel. A few dayes after this, going on shore
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47037:26"/> again, as they were loading themselves with Corn, the Indians violently assaulted them, so that they were forced to leave their Corn and stand to their Arms, At this time an Indian was killed and two English men sorely wounded. The Indians attempted the Vessels, but were entertained with such Volleys of smal shot as made them afraid to board any so the Barks arrived safe at <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Feb. 22. The Lieut. with nine Souldiers well armed, went out of the Fort to burn the woods thereabouts, being gone half a mile from home they were besett with about seventy Indians, who let fly their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows very fiercely; the English retreated, one man presently was shot in the neck and then did they lay hands on him, he drew his Sword, but that was taken from him; Then would he (as the Indians afterwards testified) have killed himself with his own knife, but that also did the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians deprive him of and cut off his nose and hands, and put him to a cruel death; They shot down another English man with three
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47037:27"/> Arrows, and a third had one of his ribs cleft with an Arrow, so that he died immeditaely. A fourth was mortally wounded, and though he got hom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yea, the Lieut. himself was wounded in this Skirmish. After this the Indians kept Leaguer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Say-brook</hi> Fort.</p>
            <p>March. 9. A body of Indians, consisting (as was conjectured) of two or three hundred came with in musket shot of the Fort, challenging the English to come out and fight, mocking and upbraiding them with such words as the English used when by them tortured to death, and bragged that they could kill English men <hi>all one flyes:</hi> But two great Gunns loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Carthages of musket bullets being fired at them, away they wont, and hearing that the <hi>Narragansets</hi> were invading their country, they visited <hi>Seybrook</hi> no more.</p>
            <p>After these things, a shallop coming down from Connecticut, with three men rowing, was set upon by several canoes of Indians, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish fought stoutly so long as they could, but one of them being shot through the nose, so as the arrow went out at the crown of his head, fell overboard and dyed: The other two were taken by the Indians, who ripped them up from the bottom of the belly to the throat, and cleft them down the back throughout, and afterwards hung them up by the neck on a tree by the River side, that the English might see them as they passed by; the shallop they drew ashore and set on fire.</p>
            <p>May. 15. 1637. Some of <hi>Ʋncas</hi> his men being then at <hi>Saybrook,</hi> in order to assisting the English against the <hi>Pequots,</hi> espyed seven Indians, and slily encompassing them, slew five of them, and took one Prisoner, and brought him to the English Fort, which was great satisfaction and encouragement to the English, who before that exploit had many fears touching the fidelity of the Moheag Indians. He whom they took Prisoner, was a perfideous Villain, one that could speak English well, having in times past lived in the fort, and knowing all the English there, had been at the slaughtering of all the English that were slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered thereabouts; He was a continual spy about the fort, informing <hi>Sassacus</hi> of what he saw or could learn. When this bloody traitor was executed, his limbs were by violence pulled from one another, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ashes; some of the Indian executioners barbarously taking his flesh, they gave it to one another, and did eat it, withall singing about the fire.</p>
            <p>It is also reported that before the <hi>Mistick,</hi> fight, a friendly Indian
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47037:27"/> that was sent thither as a secret spy, brought word that the <hi>Pequots</hi> were singing, and dancing, and bessing their God, in that they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the English were gone from them; and that in the night the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish came upon them, they were fallen into a deep sleep, by reason of their long dancing the night before, and their sentinel was gone out of his place to light a pipe of Tobacco, just as the English surprized them, and when our souldiers gave fire there was not one that missed; the <hi>Pequots</hi> so alarumed, in horrour and amazement, crying <hi>Wannocks Wannocks,</hi> i. e. Englishmen; Englishmen; some of the old men taking hold of others that were willing to run away, and saying, as we have lived together, so let us dy together, the Wigwam which was first set on fire, being to the windward side carried all before it, (as is in the Narrative intimated) At that time there were two Eng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ish men slain, (one of which was thought to be shot by an English man) and twenty four wounded, whereof one dyed within few dayes. Also fourty Indians that were friends to the English were hurt in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. It was supposed that no less then five or six hundred Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot souls were brought down to Hell that day. Moreover, it is therein added, that as the English marched towards their vessels in the River, still as they came near any swamp, they sent in a volley of shot, lest the enemy should haply be in ambush in those dark plaees of the earth, and some Indians have related that the English did by that means kill more men of war in their marching away, then in the fight at the Fort, whereby also <hi>Sassacus</hi> his plot to cut off the English as they passed by swamp-ambushments was utterly and happily frustrated.</p>
            <p>It is further said, that an Indian called <hi>Wequosh</hi> did direct the English to the Fort at <hi>Mistick,</hi> which <hi>Wequosh</hi> was by birth a Sachim of that place b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t upon some disgust received▪ he went from the Pequots to the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansets, and became a chief Captain under <hi>Miantonimo;</hi> and that there were with those eighty English Souldiers, who engaged in this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the <hi>Pequots,</hi> at first four hundred Indians, whereof three hundred were <hi>Narragansets.</hi> The day before the fight there was some agitation which Fort should be first assaulted, whether that of <hi>Mistick,</hi> or another eight miles further, where <hi>Sassacus</hi> himself resided. The English were an end to be upon <hi>Sassacus,</hi> but the Indians were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid saying, that <hi>Sassacus</hi> was <hi>all one God,</hi> and no body could kill him; this made the English yet more desirous to try what power was in this <hi>imaginary Deity,</hi> and that was the conclusion, whereupon many of the <hi>Narragansets</hi> withdrevv, and returned all home, reporting that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish vvere cut off by the Indians; the fame of which vvas quickly at
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47037:28"/> Boston; to the great affliction of the English until such time as the truth of things was certainly known. In this <hi>Interim</hi> one of Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhils</hi> Souldiers fell lame, not being able to go so far as the place where <hi>Sassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> was supposed to be; whence the Captain changed his purpose, and determined for <hi>Mistick;</hi> and Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> was not willing they should part asunder, so did they agree to make their Assault there; few or none of the Indians which were in the Fort escaped, whole companyes of them gathered together and were burnt to death; those that escaped the Fire, the English without the Fort slew them with the sword, so that round about the Fort, dead men lay, hideous to behold.</p>

            <p>Upon this notable victory <hi>Sassacus</hi> his heart failed him his men of war being many of them cut off, so that he fled his Country, breaking down his Forts, and burning his Wigwams himself, he marched away by land, with some men, women and Children, their goods being sent away in <hi>Cannoo's.</hi> The English at <hi>Say-brook</hi> had notice of the <hi>Cannoos,</hi> and an advantage to stop their passage, but Capt. <hi>Kilpatrick</hi> delayed until the opportunity was gone, so that <hi>Sassacus</hi> with his routed train coming up to the <hi>Cannoos</hi> six miles from <hi>Say-brook</hi> Fort, was transported over the River, and fled towards <hi>Quinipiack.</hi> Being now inraged he sollicited his men of War, that they might go, and fall upon the English at <hi>Connecticut,</hi> but some of them not consenting, that design of his was not put in execution; he therefore fled to the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> who (being as is supposed excited thereto by the revengfull <hi>Narragansets</hi>) cut off his head.</p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Pequots</hi> before <hi>Sassacus</hi> his death returned to their Country again; but souldiers being sent from the <hi>Massachusets</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Pequots were presently distressed, ours ran sacking their country, and setling a garrison therein, quickly came back to <hi>Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> with one of the Pequot Sachims, and other <hi>Indian</hi> Captives.

After that they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Indian Captive who likewise engaged to lead the English upon the Pequots, but he directed them into a quite contrary way, for which his life was deservedly taken from him. But an Indian called <hi>Luz,</hi> who was before taken Captive by our Souldiers in the Pequot Country, with two other Indians that were his kinsmen, promised if the English would give him, and his kinsmen their lives, He would conduct them to the Enemies they sought after. He did so, the Pequots with other Indians belonging to those parts, were found near a Swamp, into which they did betake themselves for safety, upon the approach of the English Souldiers. After a while, an Indian came out of the Swamp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, with a present of <hi>Wampam,</hi> The English declared to him that they came not to take away the lives of the Indians nor their goods, if they would deliver up the murtherers that were amongst them. After which ninety nine came forth with their Sachim, who offered as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent all the Estate he had to dispose of, and that was nothing but the Coat on his back, being a Bears Skin. He was sent into the Swamp again to signify to the Pequots there lurking, that if they would bring forth the murderers it should be better for them, which they would not do, but at last professed they had lived together, and they would dy together</p>
            <p>There were about seventy or eighty Indians in the Swamp, amongst whom there were twelve murderers. So then the English besett the Swamp; and shot in upon them, and the Indians at them, some of which were furnished with Guns. One in special that was climbing up a Tree to shoot at the English, was espyed by a Souldier, who sent a Bullet into him before the other could make his shot. In the night time the Indians brake away. Diligent search was the next day made in the Swamp for dead Indians, Not many, (as some have made Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) but seven, and no more could be found. As for the Captives a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47037:29"/> Guard was appointed to look after them, they were charged upon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of their lives not to attempt running away; yet one of them betook himself to his heels, but a Souldier shot after him, and killed him, which struck a Terror into the rest of the Captives, that no man durst make an offer to escape. These things do I find related by <hi>Anonymus,</hi> There is not much more additional to what is expressed in Mr. <hi>Allyns</hi> Narrative, some of these particulars insisted on confirming the truth of that. Only one thing more is conteined therein which I have not elsewhere met with, which therefore it may not be amiss here to take notice of. It is this, Whereas on April <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>3. 1637. The Indians coming upon the English at <hi>Wethersfield</hi> killed nine persons, and took two young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alive, and carried them away Captives, means were used to effect their deliverance, but at first, in vain.</p>
            <p>On May 8. A Dutch Sloop came by <hi>Saybrook</hi> Fort, having on Board an Indian Captive, who said she was <hi>Momonottocks</hi> Squaw. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish there desired the Dutch-men to let them have the Squaw in order to redeeming the English Captives, offering to give them to the value of two hundred pound, provided that those Capt ves might be set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The Dutchmen hoping to gain much by such an Indian were some of them loth to part with her. In Conclusion Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhil</hi> (who then commanded the Fort) having obteined the Consent of the Master of the Vessel, did <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> take the Squaw out of the Sloop. Afterwards when the <hi>Moheags</hi> came to <hi>Saybrook</hi> that Squaw appeared to be one belonging to them, whom the <hi>Pequots</hi> had Captivated, and she made the Dutch believe she was <hi>Momonottocks Squaw,</hi> hoping that thereby she should obtein the more courteous usage amongst those into whose hands she was fallen, so that the contest between the English and Dutch about her was needless. In the <hi>Interim</hi> the Dutch Governour sent another Sloop, with order to redeem the English Captives if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and those Dutch did in Conclusion wilily accomplish their design. For being arrived in the <hi>Pequot</hi> Country, certain Indians coming aboard to trade with them after they had been trafficking they were clapt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hatches, and told they should not be set at liberty, except they would deliver the English maids that were Captivated, and presently hoysted Sayle, as if they would be gone. The <hi>Pequots</hi> on shore called to them, declaring that if they would come to an Anchor, the English Captives should be brought to them, which was done, and the men whom the Dutchmen had secured in their Sloop given in Exchange for the English Captives, who were also brought safe to <hi>Saybrook,</hi> May, 16. where our Souldiers waited for a wind to carry them to engage with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47037:29"/> the <hi>Pequots,</hi> and that Wind which for a few dayes kept the English from going upon their expedition, brought that Dutch Sloop to redeem those Captives, concerning whom there was no other hope (and that was a trouble to some) but that the English would be necessitated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them amongst the Indians, in the day when their Fort should be attacqued,</p>
            <p>Some have thought that in these Narratives, there is not due notice taken of what was done by the <hi>Massachuset</hi> Forces. The Truth is, the Conquest obteined over the <hi>pequots</hi> was wonderfully the Lords doing, nor may we ascribe much to man therein, yet must it be acknowledged (and the Narratives deny it not) that Capt. <hi>Ʋnderhil</hi> (and those under his Command) who was sent from the <hi>Massachusets</hi> did acquit himself worthily, when the Indians at <hi>Mistick</hi> Fort were cut off. It must also be owned that the <hi>Massachuset</hi> Souldiers did glean the <hi>Pequots</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, (and we know who to pacify those that were unreasonably dissatisfied, was ready to say, <hi>Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And besides these things insisted on, there are who have taken notice of some other specialtyes of Divine providence, relating to those Commotions which have been of momentous consideration, to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple inhabiting this wilderness, which it may not be amiss here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. It is then worthy our observation, that the guilty bloody <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quots</hi> after they had treacherously murthered Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, brought presents of <hi>Wampam</hi> and <hi>Bever</hi> to the English at <hi>Boston,</hi> desiring their Friendship, pleading that <hi>Stone</hi> had (who was like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do it) offered some abuse to them, in surprizing divers Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and binding them, and forcing them to shew him the way up the River, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — wherefore a peace was concluded upon condition they would suffer the English who desired to inhabit <hi>Connecticut,</hi> there qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to live, and also deliver up those men who had been guilty of <hi>Stones</hi> death. These things were not performed by the <hi>Pequots.</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they were the more willing to have peace with the English was, in that they were fallen out with the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Monhatus,</hi> as also with the <hi>Narrhagansets</hi> who were then potent and numerous; and at first they thought scorn to make Overtures of peace to them, proudly designing the subjugation of all their neighbour Indians, which wrought well for the English. Howbeit not unlike him that said, — <hi>Flectere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47037:30"/> their Ends with the English, except they would let Justice have a free passage, and having Contracted fresh bleeding guilt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by new and outragious murthers, and crueltyes, they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly sollicited the <hi>Narragansets</hi> to joyn with them in their wicked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy against the English, <hi>Satan</hi> suggesting to them such Arguments as did almost prevail. For they told the <hi>Narragansets</hi> that if they joyned with the English, they did but make way for their own Ruine, since after the <hi>Pequots</hi> were conquered, they would find an occasion to fall upon the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> and that they should not need to come to open battel with the English, only fire their Houses, and kill their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and lye in ambush to shoot them as they went about their occasions, so would they quickly be forced to leave this Country, and the Indians in the mean while not exposed to any great hazard. Had the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansets</hi> been overcome by these Arguments, it would have occasioned far greater Trouble and hazard to all the English Colonyes, newly set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Land; But therefore God in mercy to his people prevented it.

                  </gap>t</hi> Country, to endeavour that those Indians might be kept from Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the enemy. There is one who having a little enquired into these things, doth <hi>Relate</hi> that the old <hi>Kanonicus</hi> did disswade the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quots from war, advising rather to deliver up the murderers. They made believe as if they would do so, and when a Band of Souldiers was sent into the <hi>Pequot</hi> Country for that end, they bid them stay a while, and the murderers should be brought to them, and certain Indians conversing with our Souldiers, did very much observe the Armor which was upon them and would point where they should hit them with their Arrows, notwithstanding. In fine, when a great Body of Indians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on an Hill not far off, those that were with the Souldiers went over to them, when they all came together, they gave a scornful shout, and so ran all away, making their boast to others, how they had deluded the English; So that <hi>Canonicus</hi> his advise to the <hi>Pequots</hi> took no effect. After which the <hi>Narragansets</hi> were not only prevailed with to decline joyning with the enemy, but (as is intimated in the above written Narrative) they pretended they would fight for the English; albeit when it came to in good earnest, they proved themselves Cowards do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little against the enemies except by unmanly insultations when they saw them in misery: For whereas it was customary with the <hi>Pequots,</hi> when they had overcome their enemies insultingly to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, saying, <hi>O brave Pequots!</hi> The <hi>Narragansets</hi> seeing them wounded or consuming to death in their burning wigwams, would taunt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47037:30"/> at them and vaunt over them, saying, <hi>O brave Pequots! O brave Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quots!</hi> The more of a divine hand is there to be taken notice of in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the <hi>Pequots</hi> by a small number of English and Indians. Also the <hi>Pequots</hi> were more furnished with Armes then before times they had been; since the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> had sold some Guns to them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their bowes and arrows they had an abundance of small hatchets, and <hi>Mohawgs</hi>-hammers made of stone, yet God would not suffer them to find their hands.</p>
            <p>What special acts of valour were manifested by any of our <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> or souldiers in this expedition, beyond what is expressed in the forementioned <hi>Narrative,</hi> I am not able to <hi>Relate;</hi> Nor am I (though willing that mens vertues should be duely acknowledged) disposed to say much on those accounts, respecting such as are yet alive, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that however it may please some by nourishing a proud humour, it would be nauseous to others and deemed adulatory by wife and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Readers.</p>
            <p>Only I remember Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi> (that good man, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Commander of the Castle at <hi>Boston,</hi> and there slain by lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) once told me, that himself, with two or three more engaged with no lesse then thirty Indians, and that there were seventeen arrows shot into his Coat, but having on a Coat of Male, none of those ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows hurt him, only one that happened to strike where he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by his Coat.</p>
            <p>Also he rescued a poor souldier, that was in extream danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devoured by those Wolves; For two Mastive-Indians that lay in ambush, as a party of souldiers passed by, supposing they had been all past, snatched hold of him whom they thought to be the last man, and were running away with him upon their shoulders, Capt. <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> followed them with his drawn Cutlash, but still as he lifted up his hand to strike at them these <hi>Gigantine Salvages</hi> held up the poor man they were running away with, whereby for a while they secured their own bodyes from the blow, until at last missing the Englishman, Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi> smote one of the Indians, whereupon they threw down their prey, and ran for their lives.</p>
            <p>He that giveth account of this last passage, doth also <hi>Relate</hi> another particular no lesse pleasant; namely, that whereas the <hi>Pequots</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the English, being willing to shew as much mercy as would stand with justice, did only captivate and not kill the <hi>Squaws,</hi> some great Indian Boyes would cry, <hi>I Squaw, I Squaw,</hi> thereby thinking to escape with their lives.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47037:31"/>
            <p>But to beserious. That which Governour <hi>Winthrop</hi> writeth in his Letter, published by Mr. <hi>Morton,</hi> is very memorable, <hi>viz.</hi> that in one sight, though the Indians coming up close to our men, shot their Arrows thick upon them, so as to pierce their hat brims, and their Sleeves, and Stockings, and other parts of their Cloaths, yet so miraculously did the Lord preserve them, as that (excepting three that rashly ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Swamp after them) not one of them was wounded. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to set aside carnal Considerations, there are two Reasons obvious, that may be assigned as causes of that glorious and speedy success, which God gave to the English against the <hi>Pequot</hi> Indians.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The blasphemy of those Enemies. For some of them said, that English mans God was one Flye, which execrable blasphemy the blessed God would not bear from those his Enemies. Also when some English were cruelly tortured to death by them, they would in a way of derision bid them call upon God now, and blasphemously mock at them when they did so. Therefore did the Lord bring those bloody blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers in a moment down to Hell, yea, and damned them above ground, when they lay frying in the Fire that was kindled upon their houses, and making horrible Outcries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was a mighty Spirit of Prayer and Faith then stirring, both in those that staid at home, and in some that ventured their lives in the high places of the Field. That Reverend man of God Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> (who excelled in those graces of Faith and Love) went forth with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were sent from this Colony. I think I have my self heard him say, (or if I have not, others have) that <hi>he was before he went out, as certain that God would give the English the Ʋictory over those Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as if he had seen the Victory already obteined.</hi> Such great Faith did the Lord stir up in the Heart of that Holy man, and of other his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and by Faith did they <hi>turn to Fight the Armyes of the Aliens.</hi> So then, these Enemies being subdued, in such wayes and by such means as hath been expressed, the Terror of God fell upon all the Heathen round about, and the English were dreadful to them: when they heard that the English had slain, and taken Captive seven hundred Indians, and killed Thirteen <hi>Sachims,</hi> (who are their Kings) there was no more Spirit left in them. The <hi>Pequots</hi> best friends were afraid to receive such as fled to them for Refuge. But happy was he counted that could make friendship with the English, so that two of the <hi>Sachims</hi> in <hi>Long-Island</hi> came to that worthy Gentleman Captain (afterwards Lieut. Colonel) <hi>Stoughton,</hi> entreating that they might be under our protection. Also two of the <hi>Napannet</hi> Sachims, addressed themselves to Governour <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:47037:31"/> seeking to be in favour with the English. These things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be mentioned amongst the <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> which he hath wrought for his <hi>New-England-People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matters being again reduced to this peaceable state, that Land rested from war, and that for the space of almost forty years together. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Jealousies amongst the English grounded upon Treacheries and Conspiracies amongst the Indians, (and some particular acts of Hostility and Outrages by them committed) there have been, more than once or twice, since the <hi>Pequot Troubles</hi> were ended.</p>
            <p>For in Anno 1638. the publick peace was endangered by occasion of a murder committed by an English man upon an Indian. Thus it was. One <hi>Arthur Peach</hi> a young Desperado, who bad been a Souldier in the <hi>Pequot</hi> war, and done notable Service, being bold and forward in any desperate Attempt after he was returned home he was loth to go to work, wherefore he resolved to go to the Dutch Plantation, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced three persons, that were other mens servants, to run away with him. As they were travailing through the woods, they met a <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganset Indian▪</hi> and desired him to take a pipe of Tobacco, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian was willing to do, <hi>Peach</hi> told his <hi>Comrades,</hi> he would kill him; they were afraid to do that, but let him alone to do as he would. When he saw his Time, He ran the Indian through with his Rapier, and took away his <hi>Wampam</hi> from him, supposing he had left him dead, but after they were gone, the Indian made a shift to get home, where he dyed of his wound within few dayes; But told other Indians that such and such English-men had mortally wounded him; The <hi>Sachims</hi> therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently found out these men (only one of them escaped) who had done the murder, and carried them away to the English, at <hi>Aquianet</hi> Island, where they were examined and committed. In the mean time the <hi>Narragansets</hi> were about to rise in Arms, some of them conceiving that they should find the <hi>Pequots</hi> words true, that the English would fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, now the other were vanquished. To be short, the murder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confessed by the partyes guilty, the Court in <hi>Plymouth</hi> did by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from Magistrates and elders in the <hi>Bay,</hi> condemn and see executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on done upon those three <hi>English men</hi> for murdering that one Indian, whereupon the other Indians magnifyed the Justice which they saw amongst the <hi>English,</hi> and peace was continued. Yet after this new fears and troubles did arise upon other accounts. For although the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> and the <hi>Moheags</hi> did Anno 1638. come under solemn promise that they would not engage in a war, either amongst themselves or with other Indians, until they had advised with, and obteined appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47037:32"/> from the English, Nevertheless <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> the chief <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganset Sachim,</hi> was continually picking quarrels with the <hi>Moheags,</hi> designing to make them become his Vassals. Some (<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gorges</hi> and Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi>) have related that <hi>Miantonimo</hi> was set on by certain <hi>vagabond English,</hi> known by the Name of <hi>Gortonians,</hi> who being deep Apostates from, and bitter enemies unto the wayes of Christ, professed by our Fathers, might easily be induced to animate motions of that nature, However <hi>Miantonimo</hi> chose rather to accomplish his ends upon the <hi>Moheags</hi> by Treachery, than by open war; and hired a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot</hi> Indian who was subjected to <hi>Ʋncas</hi> (the <hi>Moheags Sachim</hi>) to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinate him that was become his Lord, which the Indian attempted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; insomuch as on a certain evening as <hi>Ʋncas</hi> was passing from one <hi>Wigwam</hi> to another, he was shot into the arm by an arrow, but recovered the house he intended, without receiving further hurt.</p>
            <p>The Indian who was suspected about this matter, being called to an account about a great summ of <hi>Wampam-peag,</hi> by him possessed, could not give any tolerable account, how he came by his money, which augmented jealousies of his being hired by <hi>Miantonimo</hi> to kill <hi>Ʋncas. Ʋncas</hi> then made his complaint to the English; the issue was, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antonimo</hi> and the suspected Indian came to <hi>Boston,</hi> where he was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at first in the presence of <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> by whose help he had framed an <hi>Artificial Lye,</hi> saying, that one night as he came out of a thick svvamp, <hi>Ʋncas</hi> desired him to say that he vvas hired by <hi>Miantonimo</hi> to kill <hi>Ʋncas,</hi> and that therefore he cut his arm vvith the flint of his Gun, that men might think he had been shot with an arrow. This pittiful story made the English suspect <hi>Miantonimo</hi> more vehemently then ever, and upon a further private examination (much against <hi>Miantonimo</hi>'s mind) they saw cause to believe that he was secretly designing mischief against the English, as well as against <hi>Ʋncas.</hi> Nevertheless, it was thought best to dismiss him for the present, only with an engagement to remit the suspected <hi>Pequot</hi> to his Master <hi>Ʋncas:</hi> He contrary to his promise, as he was returning home cut off the poor <hi>Pequots</hi> head, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was made uncapable of discovering any thing further about matters between <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> and him.</p>
            <p>Being come home, he forthwith resolveth to be revenged upon <hi>Ʋncas,</hi> and with a thousand <hi>Narragansets</hi> gave him battel, but the <hi>Moheags,</hi> (though not half their number) worsted the <hi>Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,</hi> and took <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> their chief Sachem, prisoner, and brought him to the Town of <hi>Hartford,</hi> desiring advise from the English con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the disposal of him. The Commissioners of the united Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47037:32"/> considering that <hi>Miantonimo</hi> had shed blood by raising an unjust war against the <hi>Moheags</hi> their friends, to whom they had engaged protection, &amp; that he was treacherous to the English, &amp; peace not like to be setled among the Indians, nor continued with the English except he were dispatched (together with some other reasons, more fully expressed in the Declaration published by the Commissioners, Anno 1645.) they counselled <hi>Ʋncas</hi> to put him to death, withal prohibiting him to use any Crueltyes in the manner of his execution, it being customary with barbarous Indians (who like their Father the Devil are delighted in Crueltyes) to put their enemies to the greatest Tortures they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, when they kill them. The advice was followed <hi>Vncas</hi> led away <hi>Miantonimo</hi> as if he would carry him to another place, for custody and safety, and by the way very fairly cut off his head, as he not a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had served one of <hi>Ʋncas</hi> his men. These things hapned Anno 1643.</p>
            <p>In the next year the peace of two of these Colonies, <hi>viz,</hi> those of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>New Haven</hi> was disturbed by the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, first an English man running away from his Master, out of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> was murdered in the woods near <hi>Connecticut</hi> by an Indian; &amp; about six weeks after was discovered by another Indian, a Sagamore in those parts promised to deliver the murderer bound to the English; and having brought him to <hi>Ʋncaway</hi> a Connecticut Sachim, he was there unbound it seems by their joynt consent, &amp; left to shift for himself, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ten English men, who were forthwith sent by Mr. <hi>Ludlow</hi> to the place, seeing the murderer was escaped, laid hold on eight Indians there present, amongst whom there was a Sagamore or two, and kept them in hold two dayes, until four <hi>Sagamores</hi> ingaged themselves within one Moneth to deliver the Malefactor unto Justice; About a week after which agreement an Indian came presumptuously, and in the day time murderously assaulted an English woman, in an house in <hi>Stamford,</hi> and by three wounds (supposed mortal) left her for dead, and robbed the house. The Indians genera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly in those parts demeaned themselves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an hostile manner refused to come to the English, or to attend Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of peace, departed from their <hi>Wigwams,</hi> left their Corn unweeded, and shot off Guns near some English Plantations in a Tumultuary way, and some Indians informed that there was a purpose to fall upon the English; so that there was watching and warding day and night, <hi>New-Haven</hi> and <hi>Hartford</hi> were sent unto, that relief might be afforded to the weaker Towns, also application was made to the other Colonyes for, Assistance. At last the Indians were perswaded to deliver the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers up to Justice. So did these dark Clouds blow over.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:47037:33"/>
            <p>Nevertheless, in this year (<hi>viz.</hi> in Anno 1644.) the Rage of the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansets</hi> agaist the <hi>Moheags</hi> did break out again in greater violence than ever before, insomuch that <hi>Ʋncas</hi> was forced to betake himself to a Fort, and was there surrounded with multitudes of those Indians. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish thought it their concern, not to suffer him, to be swallowed up by those Adversaryes, since he had (though for his own ends) approved himself faithful to the English from time to time. The <hi>Narragansets</hi> perceiving that the English did (as they had Reason to) favour <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> began to be high and Insolent in their expressions &amp; actions, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to destroy the English (only as to the English at <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Island</hi> the <hi>Narraganset Sachims</hi> concluded a neutrality) as well as the <hi>Moheags.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before these things, there being four Colonyes of English Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants setled in this Country, viz. <hi>Massachusets, Plymouth, Connecticut</hi> and <hi>New-Haven,</hi> (which is since become a part of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony) who were sensible of the common danger they were exposed unto, by reason of Indians throughout this Land, as also in that <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> had seated themselves not far off, who might some of them probably prove evil Neighbours, and withal considering that, as he in the famous Poet expresseth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>When a war was with good advice concluded on, forty men were immediately sent out of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> to relieve <hi>Ʋncas,</hi> who upon the departure of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Souldiers (their time appointed them to keep Garrison with <hi>Ʋncas</hi> being expired) was presently set upon by the <hi>Narragansets;</hi> but further attempts upon him were prevented, by the coming of these from the <hi>Massachusets.</hi> Also before the other Colonies could expedite what concerned the whole design, Forces were sent out of Plymouth, under the command of Capt. <hi>Standish,</hi> and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as far as <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> that being near the borders of the enemy.</p>
            <p>That worthy Commander, Major <hi>Edward Gibbons,</hi> was appointed as <hi>General,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thompson</hi> Pastor of the Church in <hi>Braintree,</hi> being in

They did solemnly take their leave of their friends and were solemnly commended to the Blessing of the God of Armies: But as they were just marching out of <hi>Boston,</hi> (their baggage being sent before towards the enemies quarters) many of the principal <hi>Narraganset</hi> Indians, viz <hi>Pessicus, Mexano,</hi> &amp; <hi>Witawash</hi> Sagamores, and <hi>Awasequin</hi> deputy for the <hi>Nianticks,</hi> these with a large Train came to <hi>Boston,</hi> suing for peace, being willing to submit to what Terms the English should see cause to impose upon them.</p>
            <p>It was demanded of them that they should defray the charges that they had put the English to and that the <hi>Sachims</hi> should send their sons to be kept as Hostages in the hands of the English until such time as the money should be payed. All this did the <hi>Narragansets</hi> yield unto,</p>
            <q>Mel in ore, verba lactis, Fel in corde fraus in factis.</q>
            <p>Notwithstanding the <hi>Narragansets</hi> have dissembled friendship with the English, yet venome hath been in their hearts ever since these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Nor was there any other then <hi>Fides Graeca</hi> observed by them, in the performance of their engagements.</p>
            <p>In the first place they endeavoured to play <hi>Leger de main</hi> in their sending Hostages. For instead of <hi>Sachems</hi> Children they thought to send some other, and to make the English believe that those base <hi>papooses,</hi> were of a royal progeny, but they had those to deal with, who were too wise to be so eluded. After the expected <hi>Hostages,</hi> were in the hands of the English, the <hi>Narragansets</hi> notwithstanding that, were slow in the performance of what they stood engaged for. And when upon a partial discharge of the debt, their Hostages were restored to them, they become more backward than formerly, until they were by hostile preparations again and again terrified into better obedience. At last Major <hi>Atherton,</hi> (then Capt. <hi>Atherton</hi>) of <hi>Dorchester</hi> was sent with a small party of English Souldiers to demand what was due. He at first entred into the <hi>Wigwam,</hi> where old <hi>Ninnigret</hi> (the <hi>Nyantick</hi> Sachim) resided, with only two or three Souldiers, appointing the rest by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to follow him, two or three dropping in at once, when his small Company were come about him that Indians in the mean time suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that there had been many more behind, he caught the Sachim by the hair of his head, and set a pistol to his breast, protesting who ever esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, he should surely dy, if he did not forthwith comply with what was required. Hereupon a great tremb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nor was there (so far as I am informed) after this any open discovery of enmity in the <hi>Narragansets</hi> against the English until such time as <hi>Philip</hi> began his his great Rebellion. Yet it is evident that there hath been treachery, and secret Treason against the English, amongst them.</p>

            <p>I have been told that a man of God (viz.

            <p>Considering, that the <hi>Narraganset Troubles</hi> have been of no small concernment, it would be worth the while a little more fully to relate the Truth about those motions. Only it is already done in good part by that Declaration which was published by the Commissioners of these united Colonies Anno. 1645.

For I find upon publick <hi>Record,</hi> that complaints and informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about that matter (in September, 1646) were brought before the Commissioners then assembled at <hi>New-haven,</hi> where an Indian testified that <hi>Sequasson</hi> the <hi>Sachim</hi> of <hi>Waranoke,</hi> had given him a sum of money on condition that he would murther the Gentlemen mentioned.</p>
            <p>Before the Commissioners convened, Mr. <hi>Haines</hi> had twice sent to <hi>Sequasson;</hi> but he neglected to make his appearance: Wherefore <hi>Jonathan Gilbert</hi> was sent to him again, to signifie from the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that they expected <hi>Sequassons</hi> appearance before them, and to answer what he was accused with and they promised him free passage both to and from <hi>New haven,</hi> withall intimating that his withdrawing himself would greatly augment the suspition of his guilt.</p>
            <p>The Messenger quickly returned, bringing word, that he could not speak with <hi>Sequasson,</hi> who he supposed had received notice of his coming by other Indians, and was thereupon fled.</p>
            <p>But a few days after, <hi>Nipnisoit</hi> and <hi>Naimetayhu</hi> two <hi>Sagamores,</hi> came with some other Indians to <hi>Newhaven,</hi> declaring that they were friends to <hi>Sequasson,</hi> and pretended great respect to the English, and that they had brought <hi>Sequasson</hi> to clear himself, and that although one of them had him by one arm, another by the other, when he was come near the town, he brake from them and was escaped.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners told them they intended <hi>Sequasson</hi> no hurt; but desired to bring him and his accusers face to face, that he should have a just bearing in their presence.</p>
            <p>Some other Indians informed that <hi>Sequasson</hi> was within a mile of <hi>Newhaven,</hi> and it was conceived that he would gladly make his peace by some other means, rather then by a due examination and Trial. The two <hi>Sagamores</hi> said he was much afraid, and durst not come, though they confessed it was just he should come and clear himself, if innocent; all which being considered, the Commissioners conceived that <hi>Sequasson</hi> whether guilty or afraid of the English, would still be plotting against them and so prove dangerous; wherefore they thought fit, and ordered that all just and prudent means should be used (his life being preserved) to bring him to a tryal, that the matter might be some way issued. In the mean time they thought good to examine <hi>Wotchiborow</hi> a <hi>Pocatuck</hi> Indian, <hi>Sequassons</hi> accuser, who waited to give in evidence against him. He being warned by <hi>Thomas Stanton</hi> the Interpreter, to speak nothing but truth) affirmed, that being this last Spring at <hi>Waranoke,</hi> in a wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam with <hi>Sequasson,</hi> and ready to depart, <hi>Sequasson</hi> perswaded him to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47037:35"/> stay three days, thence he drew him to the <hi>Falls</hi> above Mr. <hi>Pinchons;</hi> when they had been there four dayes, <hi>Wotchiborow</hi> would have been gone to <hi>Moheag,</hi> to see some friends; <hi>Se quasson</hi> told him it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous travelling that way he would be killed, walked along with him to a Spring, and there told him, that if ever he would doe the said <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quasson</hi> a kindness now was a time, he was almost ruined, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish at <hi>Hartford,</hi> the cause of it: He should therefore go to <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and kill Mr. <hi>Hopkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hains,</hi> and Mr. <hi>VVhiting</hi> and he would give him a reward, and thereupon pluckt out of his bag three gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of <hi>Wampam,</hi> and gave them to him, with a piece of a girdle of <hi>wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam</hi> to play, and promised him much more. <hi>Wotchiborow</hi> said it was dangerous to kill an English <hi>Sachim,</hi> they would find out the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and pursue him to death; what could then <hi>wampam</hi> doe him good? <hi>Sequasson</hi> said he had store of <hi>wampam,</hi> when the thing was done they would fly to the <hi>Mohawkes,</hi> but in the way, when they came to the <hi>Wampeag-Indians,</hi> he should give it out that <hi>Ʋncas</hi> had hired him for so much <hi>wampam,</hi> and that would set the English against <hi>Ʋncas,</hi> &amp; then he the said <hi>Sequasson</hi> should rise again.</p>
            <p>He further told this <hi>Examinate,</hi> that <hi>Naymetayhu,</hi> one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Sagamores</hi> that came on the behalf of <hi>Sequasson,</hi> and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, knew and approved of the said murther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wotchiborow</hi> further saith, that having taken the aforesaid <hi>wampam,</hi> he remembred that himself had formerly taken <hi>Bushe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He said further, that <hi>Sequasson</hi> hearing of the discovery, spake to <hi>Romanoke</hi> an Indian, and he sent another Indian called <hi>Sixpence</hi> to this Examinate, desiring him to hide and conceal as much of the Plot as he could and not to say all open, but he in anger bad the said <hi>Sixp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus much doe I find upon Record, relating to <hi>Sequassons</hi> plot. What afterwards came of this business, or how it issued, I cannot say. There was also another trouble about the Indians this year.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:47037:35"/>
            <p>For whilst the Commissioners were sitting at <hi>Newhaven,</hi> petitions were presented from <hi>Edward Elmere</hi> and some others, complaining that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians had wilfully and maliciously burned some quantity of pitch, and Tarr of theirs, together with some bedding, and a Cart with its furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tooles &amp;c. in value above an hundred pounds. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they complained of one <hi>Wasemose,</hi> a <hi>Waranoke</hi> Indian as guilty therein, as by sufficient evidence they thought they could prove; and that he hath since avoided all the English Plantations; and that he being sent for by a warrant from one of the Magistrates of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> fled; but being overtaken and seized by some of the English, he was rescued by the Indians, and the English by them jeered and abused, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Chickwallop</hi> Sachim of <hi>Norwootuck:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Jonathan Gilbert</hi> and <hi>John Griffin,</hi> were sent to <hi>Chickwallop and Manasanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At their return, they informed that they could not meet either with <hi>Chickwallop</hi> or <hi>Manasanes,</hi> but the <hi>Sagamores</hi> and Indians at <hi>Wara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noke</hi> carried it insolently towards the English, vaunting themselves in their Arms, bows and Arrows, hatchets and Swords, some with their Guns ready charged, before and in the presence of the English Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, they primed and cockt them ready to give fire, and told them, that if they should offer to carry away any men thence, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were resolved to fight, yet the next morning the <hi>Sachim</hi> with some others offered the English Messengers eight Farhom of <hi>Wampam</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards satisfaction, and promised to provide more. The Messengers not having any thing to that purpose in their Commission, advised the <hi>Sachim</hi> to send to the Commissioners, but he refused. Hereupon, <hi>Naymetayhu</hi> one of the <hi>Sagamores</hi> of <hi>Waranoke,</hi> who, as before, came on <hi>Sequassons</hi> behalf, was questioned by the Commissioners about these proud Affronts to the English; At first he denyed what was charged, and excused some part, but one of the English Messengers being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and he hearing the rest should be sent for, he fell under most of the charge, professing that he intended no harm to the English, Thus concerning disturbance by the Indians in the yerr, 1646.</p>
            <p>In Anno, 1647. New fears and troubles arose by reason of the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganset</hi> Indians, there being credible Informations that they were plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and by presents of <hi>Wampam</hi> ingaging the Indians round about to combine with them against the English Colonyes, insomuch that a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commissioners was called before the ordinary time; Being therefore convened at <hi>Boston,</hi> July 26. A Messenger was sent to <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganset,</hi> signifying to <hi>Pesicus</hi> and other <hi>Sachims</hi> there, that the English Commissioners expected their appearance at <hi>Boston,</hi> and that if they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47037:36"/> did refuse or delay, they should no more be sent unto withal promising them safe conduct, in Case they duly attended. The Messenger being returned informed that <hi>Pesicus</hi> excused his not meeting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners at <hi>New Haven</hi> the last year, from his ignorance of the time. when he should attend, though that was falsly pretended by him. He also desired excuse for his not appearing at this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he said he was sick, and not able to come, (but the Messengers could not perceive that he was subject to any such sickness or disable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) Nevertheless, he had given full power to <hi>Ninnigret</hi> to act on his behalf. Moreover, he excused his not performing the <hi>Articles</hi> he had subscribed at <hi>Boston,</hi> two years before, by pretending that he was frighted into that Engagement, with the sight of the English Army, which was then ready to invade the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Country, and he thought they would follow him home, and there kill him if he did not promise to do as the English would have him.</p>
            <p>August 3. <hi>Ninnigret</hi> with some <hi>Niantick</hi> Indians, and two of <hi>Pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicus</hi> his men came to <hi>Boston.</hi> At first he (though against his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) made as if he were ignorant, and never been informed of the Covenants which the Indians had made to the English, and seemed to wonder that the English should ask such a Sum of <hi>Wampam,</hi> saying that he knew not that the Indians were in the Englishmens Debt. He was then put in mind, how that formerly satisfaction had been deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Indians for the breach of Articles; and how the English Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers had been ill intreated by them, and particularly by himself, who had used threatning and insolent, language, saying to the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, that he knew the Commissioners would endeavour to keep them from warring upon <hi>Ʋncas,</hi> but they were resolved they would do it for all that, and nothing but <hi>Ʋncas</hi> his head should satisfy them; and that if the English did not withdraw their Garrisons from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Ʋncas,</hi> they would heap up their Cattel as high as their <hi>wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams,</hi> and that he was the man that had given out that an Englishman should not step out of doors to piss but they would kill him. <hi>Ninigret</hi> not being able to deny these charges, and somewhat appalled thereat, began to comply with the reasonable demands of the English. A dayes time was allowed to him for Consideration and advice with the rest of the Indian Deputyes that were then in <hi>Boston.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day he declared that he was resolved to give the English Colonies due Satisfaction in all things, and that he would forthwith send some of his men to gather up the <hi>wampam</hi> which was yet behind hoping that within ten dayes it might be obtained, and that himself
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47037:36"/> would stay with the English as security, untill the money was paid. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, he dispatched his Messengers home for that end, who not many dayes after, came back to <hi>Boston,</hi> bringing with them two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fathom of <hi>Wampam,</hi> towards satisfaction of what they owed to the English. This falling very much short of what was expected, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigret</hi> pleaded that his personal absence from home was the cause of that defect, and therefore desired liberty to go home, withal adding, that if the whole were not paid by next spring, the English should take his head, and seize his Country. The Commissioners let him depart, and since he pretended so fair, did deliver to him the Children which were kept as <hi>Hostages,</hi> expecting from him, the more care to see engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments performed; and if they did find him real, that then former neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects should be charged upon <hi>Pesicus,</hi> and that they should expect his assistance, when it should be required, in recovering the whole remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from <hi>Pesicus,</hi> all which things were cheerfully accepted by <hi>Ninni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This year other <hi>Troubles</hi> hapned by some of <hi>Vncas</hi> his Indians, who committed several Outrages upon the English in the <hi>Pequot</hi> Country.

            <p>In <hi>September</hi> 1648. New complaints were brought before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the united Colonyes, (then sitting at <hi>Plymouth</hi>) against the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Indians, <hi>Henry Bull</hi> of <hi>Rhode-Island</hi> petitioned for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, informing that those Indians had beaten him, and other wayes been injurious to him. Also Messengers from the Town of <hi>Warwick</hi> came with complaints in behalf of the whole Town, alleadging that their neighbour Indians did kill their Cattel, abuse their servants when they took them alone, &amp; sometimes would make forcible entry into their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses yea and strike the masters thereof, and steal, and purloyne their goods at pleasure. At the same time, informations were brought before the Commissioners, that the <hi>Naragansit</hi> Indians, instead of paying the <hi>Wampam,</hi> that was due to the Colonyes, had improved their <hi>Wampam</hi> o hire Indians to invade <hi>Ʋncas,</hi> and in case the English should defend
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47037:37"/> him, to fight with them also. Particularly, that <hi>Ninnigret</hi> had given out, that if the English did protect <hi>Ʋncas,</hi> he would quickly burn the houses at <hi>Connecticut.</hi> The <hi>Narragansets</hi> were withdrawing their old men, women, and children into swamps, hiding their corn <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The mercenary <hi>Mohawks</hi> were said to be about four hundred in number, all armed with guns, and three pound of powder for every man.</p>
            <p>These Counsils were so far ripened and prepared for execution, as that <hi>Thomas Stanton</hi> and other messengers from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> goeing to the Indians to enquire into, and (if it might be) stop proceedings, found them met at <hi>Pacomptuck</hi> their Rande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But these things made it yet more evident, that the <hi>Narragansets</hi> were a false and treacherous people, not to be trusted, nor worthy to be treated with.</p>

                  </gap>horon</hi> fell a trembling, and hereby confirmed the suspition of the English, and wrought a suspition in some of the <hi>Mohegin</hi> Indians, so that they said these two Indians were <hi>Matchet,</hi> meaning they were guilty. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Indians thereabouts excused the <hi>Sagamores</hi> Son, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47037:37"/>
               <hi>Toquattos,</hi> &amp; intimated that if the Sagamores Son should upon sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition be seized on by the English, the Indians would doe the like by some English, untill he should be set at liberty.</p>
            <p>Likewise at <hi>South-hampton</hi> in <hi>Long-Island,</hi> the English were exposed to great difficulties and dangers by reason of a murder committed in that Town, so that they were necessitated to <hi>Arm</hi> themselves, and stand upon their own defence for many dayes; the Indians being gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an hostile posture. This year also <hi>Ʋncas</hi> renewed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Indians, that notwithstanding all former engagements, they are still undermining his peace, and seeking his ruine, and in particular that to their late endeavour to bring the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks</hi> upon him, when that failed, they sought by witchcraft to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life. A <hi>Narraganset</hi> Indian (called <hi>Cuttaquin</hi>) in an English Vessel in <hi>Mohegin</hi> River, ran a Sword into <hi>Ʋncas</hi> his breast, whereby he received to all appearance a mortal wound, which murderous act, the Assailant then confessed, he was for a considerable sum of <hi>Wampam,</hi> by the <hi>Narraganset</hi> and <hi>Niantick</hi> Sachims hired to attempt, <hi>Ninnigret</hi> when examined utterly denyed his having an hand in that fact but affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that <hi>Cuttaquin,</hi> who accused himself, and the other Sachims, was drawn thereunto, by Torture from the <hi>Moheags,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About four years after this (<hi>viz.</hi> in Anno 1653.) there were great <hi>Troubles,</hi> and Commotions raised in the Spirits of men with reference to the Indians, it being generally believed that there was an horrid Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy amongst the Indians throughout this Land to cut off all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and that they were animated thereto by the Dutch, there being at that time war between England and Holland. An Indian <hi>Squaw</hi> was sent by other Indians (that professed love and friendship) to one in <hi>Whether field</hi> on <hi>Connecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut,</hi> informing that there was a Confederacy between the Dutch and indians, to destroy the English Colonyes, and that the day of Election of Magistrates in the several Jurisdictions was intended for execution, because then the Towns would be left naked and less able to defend themselves. This Squaw moreover desired the Engli h to remember, how dear their slighting of her former informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Pequots</hi> coming had cost them.</p>
            <p>Also <hi>Ʋncas</hi> addressed himself to the Governour of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony declaring that <hi>Ninnigret</hi> had that winter been at <hi>Manhatos,</hi> and that he had given the Dutch Governour a great present of <hi>Wampam,</hi> and received from him twenty Gunns, with powder and shot answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47037:38"/> and that during his stay in those parts he went over <hi>Hudsons</hi> River, gathered as many <hi>Sachims</hi> together as he could, made ample Declaration against the English, desiring their aid and assistance against them.</p>
            <p>Yea moreover, there were no less then nine Indian <hi>Sagamores,</hi> who lived near <hi>Manhatos,</hi> did voluntarily without any notice or reward from the Eng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ish, send their Messengers to <hi>Stamford,</hi> declaring and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming (even after they were urged by the English to testifie nothing but the truth) that the Dutch had sollicited them by promising them Gunns, Swords, Powder, Wampam, Wast-coats and Coats to cut off the English. The Messengers added that they would not lye, &amp; were as the mouth of the nine Sagamores, who <hi>All speak they no lye,</hi> they would affirm it to the Dutch Governours face, and if the Dutch were angry, and should fight with them, <hi>No force &amp;c.</hi> The next day, one of those Sagamores, with the Son and Brother of another of them came themselves to <hi>Stamford,</hi> and confirmed what their Messengers in their names had before reported.</p>
            <p>This Spring also, the Indians in the <hi>Northern &amp; Eastern</hi> parts gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grew insolent, and their cariage very suspitious, and they gave out threatning words, so that many Alarms were made, the peace of the English through the whole Country disturbed, they wearied with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Watchings and Wardings, hindred in their Plowing, Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preparations for Planting and other Occasions, to their exceeding great Damage. These things caused many sad thoughts of hearts, and some warlike Preparations; but when the Partyes accused were enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of about these matters they would own nothing; as for <hi>Ninigret</hi> he pretended that his wintering amongst the Dutch was on the account of his health, and not at all out of design against the English. The rest of the <hi>Narraganset Sachims</hi> made themselves very ignorant of any Plot; the Dutch Governour likewise professed great abhorrency of so vile a thing as that would be, to hire barbarous Indians to murder Christians; withall adding, that if the Colonies fell upon him on that account, the righteous Judge would be his Defence, and that,</p>
            <q>
               <l>— Hic murus aheneus esto</l>
               <l>Nil conscire sibi nullâ pallescere culpâ.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Also glad tidings of peace between the Nations at home arrived here so did these troubles vanish.</p>
            <p>Albeit not many years after these things, the Indians in those parts made an horrible slaughter, not of English-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n but of Dutch-men, who were treacherously massacred by them.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:47037:38"/>
            <p>In the latter end of this year it was, that the <hi>Montauket</hi> or Long-Island Indians who were friends and Tributaryes to the English, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that <hi>Ninnigret</hi> and the <hi>Nianticks</hi> had assaulted them, killing and taking Captive diverse of them. They were so far hearkned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as that the Commissioners of the united Colonies did apprehend themselves called of God to wage Warr against <hi>Ninigret,</hi> and such Indians as should adhere to him in his bloudy proceedings, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did by vote conclude and determine the same, and that two hundred and fifty Souldiers should be forthwith raised, and sent forth by the several Colonies. But the Council at <hi>Boston</hi> not concurring in those Conclusions, the intended expedition failed at that time. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless the next year, it being known that <hi>Ninnigret</hi> persisted in his Warring upon the Long Islanders, and that he brake his Covenant, refusing to pay tribute for those <hi>Pequots</hi> that were by the English for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly placed under him, and that the lenity of the Colonies was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used to heighten his pride and insolency; upon these Considerations it was agreed by the Commissioners that there should be two hundred and seventy Foot Souldiers, and forty Horse, raised out of the several Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonyes, in order to reducing <hi>Ninnigret</hi> to subjection and better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Accordingly Forces were forthwith levied, and a small Army sent forth under the Christian and couragious Major <hi>Willard</hi> as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief.</p>
            <p>Upon the approach of the English Army <hi>Ninnigret</hi> fled from the place of his usual Residence, and got into a Swamp, where it was not easie to pursue him. Most of the <hi>Pequots</hi> under his Jurisdiction then deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and came to the English. Messengers were sent to demand a Treaty with him, but he was afraid to appear.</p>
            <p>In fine, two Gentlemen, viz. Capt. <hi>Davis</hi> and Capt. <hi>Siely</hi> went to him requiring the delivery of the rest of the <hi>Pequots;</hi> to whom he replyed that they were gone on hunting, but ingaged that within seven dayes they should be delivered to Mr. <hi>Winthrop.</hi> He was moreover charged to forbear all acts of Hostility against the Long-Islanders, or any other Indians that were in amity with the English; and plainly told, that if he did not hearken to the advice and charge laid upon him, he must expect that ere long his head would be set upon an English pole.</p>
            <p>So did the Messengers return and the Army also. These things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in October Anno 1654.</p>
            <p>After the English forces were withdrawn, <hi>Ninnigret</hi> did according to his usual manner, observe <hi>Fidem punicam</hi> in keeping the promises which at that time he had made and set his hand unto.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:47037:39"/>
            <p>Not many years after this the Indians in the Southern and Western parts of this Land were involved in broyles amongst themselves, raging with implacable feuds and wars one against another. The <hi>Nianticks, Mauntaukets, Mohegins, Norwootucks,</hi> all engaged in cruel and bloody quarrels. And the peace of these Colonyes was not a little disturbed and endangered thereby, inasmuch as the Indians would pursue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to the English plantations, and sometimes into the English hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and there kill one another. Some English at <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> and some inhabiting in the <hi>Moheag</hi> Country were by means hereof put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sad frights. In special, in Anno 1658, sundry English in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were disquieted by the insolence and outrage of the <hi>Pacumptick</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. But when the <hi>Sachims</hi> were called to an account about it, they pretended that they were ignorant of what disorders were committed by their men, nor allowed of by them who desired to live in amity with the English, and were willing to give satisfaction for past injuryes, and to prevent the like abuses for the Future. So did those Troubles pass over. Not very long before this, at <hi>South-Hampton</hi> in <hi>Long Island</hi> some houses had been burned by a wicked Indian (and a <hi>Negro</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) who it seems after he had done this wic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edness, desperately killed himself, to prevent just execution. It was at first thought that more of the Indians there had had an hand in that burning, whence they were condemned to pay seven hundred pound in seven years, but afterwards that penalty was taken off, since it was judged unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that those Indians who were not proved to act in, or consent to the mischief that was done, should be made to suffer as guilty.</p>
            <p>In Anno 1662, <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony was in some danger of being invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Trouble by the <hi>Wampanoag</hi> Indians. After <hi>Massasoit</hi> was dead, his two sons, called <hi>Wamsutta,</hi> &amp; <hi>Metacomet,</hi> came to the court at <hi>Plymou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h</hi> pretending high respect for the English, and therefore desired English names might be imposed on them, whereupon the Court there named <hi>Wamsutta</hi> (the elder brother) <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Metacomet</hi> (the younger brother) <hi>Philip;</hi> this <hi>Alexander (Philips</hi> immediate predecessor) was not so faithful and friendly to the English as his Father had been. For some of <hi>Boston</hi> having been occasionally at <hi>Narraganset,</hi> wrote to Mr. <hi>Prince</hi> who was then Governour of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mischief against the English, and that he had sollicited the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragangansets</hi> to ingage with him in his designed rebellion. Hereupon, Capt. <hi>Willet</hi> (who lived near to <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> the place where <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> did reside) was appointed to speak with him, and to desire him to attend the next Court in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> for their satisfaction, and his own
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47037:39"/> vindication he seemed to take the message in good part, professing that the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> who (he said) were his enemies, had put an abuse upon him, and he readily promised to attend at the next Court. But when the day for his appearance was come, instead of that, he at that very time went over to the <hi>Narragansets</hi> his pretended enemies, which compared with other Circumstances, caused the Gentlemen at <hi>Plymouth</hi> to suspect there was more of Truth in the Information given, than at first they were aware of. Wherefore the Governour and Magistrates there, ordered Major <hi>Winsl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w</hi> (who is since and at this day the Governour of that Colony) to take a party of men, and fetch down <hi>Alexander.</hi> The Major considering that <hi>semper no cuit differre paratis,</hi> he took but ten armed men with him from <hi>Marshfield,</hi> intending to have taken more at the Towns that lay nearer <hi>Mount-Hope.</hi> But divine providence so ordered, as that when they were about the midway between <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gwater,</hi> observing an hunting house, they rode up to it, and there did they find <hi>Alexander</hi> and many of his men well armed, but their Guns standing together without the house, the Major with his small party, possessed themselves of the Indians Arms, and beset the house; then did he go in amongst them, acquainting the <hi>Sachim</hi> with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his coming in such a way, desiring <hi>Alexander</hi> with his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to walk out with him, who did so a little distance from the house, and then understood what Commission the <hi>Major</hi> had received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. The proud <hi>Sachim</hi> fell into a raging passion at this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, saying that the Governour had no reason to credit Rumors, or to send for him in such a way nor would he go to <hi>Plymouth</hi> but when he saw cause. It was replyed to him, that his breach of word touching ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at <hi>Plymouth</hi> Court, and instead thereof going at the same time to his pretended enemies, augmented jealousies concerning him. In fine the <hi>Major</hi> told him, that his order was to bring him to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and that (by the help of God) he would do it, or else he would dy on the place; Also declaring to him that if he would submit, he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect respective usage, but if he once more denyed to go, he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stir from the ground whereon he stood, and with a Pistol at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chims</hi> breast, required that his next words should be a positive and clear Answer to what was demanded. Hereupon his Interpreter (a discreet Indian, brother to <hi>John Sausaman</hi>) being sensible of <hi>Alexanders</hi> passionate disposition, entreated that he might speak a few words to the <hi>Sachim,</hi> before he gave his Answer. The prudent discourse of this Indian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed so far as that <hi>Alexander</hi> yielded to go, only requesting that he might go like a <hi>Sachim,</hi> with his men attending him, which (although
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47037:40"/> there was some hazard in it, they being many, and the English but a few) was granted to him. The weather being hot, the Major offered him an horse to ride on, but his squaw and diverse Indian women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in company, he refused, saying he could go on foot as well as they, entreating only that there might be a complying with their pace, which was done, and resting several times by the way, <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were refreshed by the English; no other discourse hapning while they were upon their march, but what was pleasant and amicable. The <hi>Major</hi> sent a man before, to entreat that as many of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of that Colony as could; would meet at <hi>Duxbury;</hi> wherefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there had some treaty with <hi>Alexander,</hi> not willing to commit him to prison, they entreated Major <hi>Winslow</hi> to receive him to his house, until the Governour (who then lived at <hi>Eastham</hi>) could come up. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he and his Train were courteously entertained by the Major. And albeit not so much as an angry word passed between them whilst at <hi>Marshfield,</hi> yet proud <hi>Alexander</hi> vexing and fretting in his spirit, that such a check was given him, he sudeenly fell sick of a fever. He was then nursed as a choice friend. Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> (the Physitian) coming providentially thither at that time, the Sachim and his men earnestly desired that he would administer to him, which he was unwilling to doe, but by their importunity was prevailed with to doe the best he could to help him, and therefore gave him a potion of wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing Physick, which the Indians thought did him good; but his distemper afterward prevailing, they entreated to dismiss him, in order to a return home, which upon engagement of appearance at the next Court was granted to him, soon after his being returned home, he dyed.</p>
            <p>And this is the truth and substance of what concerns Transactions with <hi>Alexander,</hi> concerning which so many fabulous storyes have been spread abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> being dead, his Brother <hi>Philip</hi> (of late cursed memory) rose up in his stead, and he was no sooner styled <hi>Sachim,</hi> but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in the year 1662. there were vehement suspitions of his bloudy treachery against the English: Yet he professed otherwise, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his personal appearance at a Court holden at Plymouth, renewed that Covenant which his father and Brother had confirmed with the English there. This Covenant he perfidiously brake: For in Anno 1671. it was evident that he with other his Confederates had been conspiring against the Colony, under whose protection and Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had submitted himself. He then armed himself and acted like a Rebel that intended a speedy rising, yea he ordered (as some Indians
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47037:40"/> have sine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> confessed) that if the English did send messengers to Treat with him, if above four came in company together they should be shot down, and appointed some to ly in ambush for that end; and behaved himself after a surly and provoking manner towards messengers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Treaty with him, and refused to appear, and give answer for his Insolencyes, his Covenant notwithstanding. Nevertheless, he at last conceded to meet the Governour and Magistrates of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> at <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> where sundry Commissioners of <hi>Boston</hi> were desired to be, and to hear the matters of difference between the English of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and this <hi>Philip</hi> Sachim.— This meeting was attended in <hi>April,</hi> 1671. when <hi>Philip</hi> confessed his breach of Covenant, and that he had groundlesly taken up Arms against them, whom he had alwayes found friendly to him; And surrendred some of his Arms, engaging for the delivery of the rest in due time. The English being tender of shedding blood, let him go upon promise of better behaviour for the future. Soon after this, <hi>Philip</hi> (with some of his Counsellors) repaired to <hi>Boston,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to possess the English there, with lying Informations, about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juryes done to him by those of <hi>Plymouth.</hi> Wherefore the Council of that Colony entreated that Commissioners from <hi>Boston,</hi> and from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> also might be sent to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that so a fair hearing of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences before all the world might be attended. So then in <hi>September</hi> following the Governour of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and several Magistrates from the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> and some other Gentlemen met at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p</hi> appeared, and all his allegations were heard to the Conviction of <hi>Philip</hi> himself, and great satisfaction of all that Audience. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion was, <hi>Philip</hi> acknowledged his offence, and was appointed to give a sum of mony to defray the charges which his Insolent Clamours had put that Colony unto. The particulars which <hi>Philip</hi> then consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to were these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he would for the future be subject to the Government of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and to their Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He engaged to pay the Colony an hundred pound towards repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of such wrong as they had susteined by his misdemeanors.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He was under obligation to send five wolves heads every year to the Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi> in Token of his fealty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he would not make war with any without the approbation of that Government.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In case any future difference should arise between him and the English, he would repair to the Government there to rectify matters, before ingaging in any hostile attempts.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:47037:41"/>
            <p n="6">6. That he would not dispose of any of his Lands but with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the English government there. So was he dismissed. Some of these Covenants were in part observed by him, and some particulars not at all—Thus did things rest between the English and him, until the year 1674. when in <hi>January</hi> an Indian Preacher, known by the name of <hi>John Sausaman,</hi> addressed himself to the present Governour of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> informing him that the Indians were complotting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the English, and that not only the <hi>Wompanoags,</hi> but the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> yea and the <hi>Mohegins</hi> were involving themselves in this Conspiracy. This <hi>Sausaman</hi> was by birth a <hi>Massachuset,</hi> his Father and Mother living in <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and they both died Christians: This their Son did for some time apostatize from his Christian profession, and lived like an Heathen, being Philips Secretary (for he could write a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry legible hand) and one of his Counsellors, untill at last God convinced him of his misery, and he manifested such evident signs of repentance as that he was, after his return from pagan <hi>Philip,</hi> reconciled to the praying Indians and baptised, and received as a member in one of the Indian Churches, yea and imployed as an Instructor amongst them every Lords Day. Nevertheless, his information (because it had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian original, and one can hardly believe them when they speak truth) was not at first much regarded, untill by relation of Circumstances, he made it too apparent, that <hi>Philip</hi> was really hatching mischief. The effect was, the Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi> advising with his Councill, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved once more to send for <hi>Philip,</hi> and to enquire into the truth of things: But before that could be accomplished, an Indian called <hi>Tobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> with his Son, and another Indian named <hi>Mattashinnamy,</hi> meeting with <hi>John Sausaman</hi> at a pond, cruelly murthered him; and that their villany might not be discovered, they cut an hole through the Ice, and put in the dead murthered Body, leaving his hat and Gun upon the Ice, that so others might think that he had drowned himself. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rumor'd that <hi>Sausaman</hi> was lost, the dead body was sought after, and found in the pond, and taken up and buried.</p>
            <p>Jealousies being on the spirits of men that the other Indians had murthered him, on the account of revealing their Conspiracyes to the English: The Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi> ordered the Constable of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlebury</hi> (that being the nearest town to the Place where the murther was committed) to cause <hi>John Sausamans</hi> body to be taken up again, and to empanel a Jury as a <hi>Coroners Inquest,</hi> to make enquiry how he came by his death: And they found that he had been murthered, for his neck was broken by twisting of his head round; which is the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47037:41"/> way that the Indians some times use when they practice murthers; also, his head was extreamly swollen, and his Body was wounded in several parts of it, and when it was first taken out of the pond, no water issued out of it, which argued that the Body was not drowned, but dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came into the water.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when <hi>Tobias</hi> (the suspected Murtherer) came near the dead body, it fell a bleeding on fresh as if it had been newly slain-albeit it was buried a considerable time before that.</p>
            <p>Afterward an Indian called <hi>Patuckson,</hi> came and testified to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he saw <hi>Tobias</hi> and the other Indians murthering <hi>Sausaman:</hi> He also himself before his death had declared, that he was afraid those very Indians would at last prove his Murtherers.</p>
            <p>They were therefore apprehended &amp; kept in Durance untill Plymouth Court, which was held in June, 1675. and being found guilty of <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saman</hi>'s Death, they were (one of them before his execution confessing the murther) condemned and executed. And then did <hi>Philip,</hi> being (as was verily supposed) privy to what <hi>Tobias</hi> (his Counsellor) and those w th him had perpetrated upon <hi>John Sausaman,</hi> fall to open Rebellion and bloodshedding amongst the English at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> who were his next Neighbours.</p>
            <p>But of the special Occurrences attending the late (and not yet ended) <hi>War</hi> between the English and the Indians, I have elsewhore given a brief account, and therefore shall not here add any thing, that not compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with my present design.</p>
            <p>The Particulars which have been mentioned, are the chief (if not the only) Troubles which have hapned by the Indians in <hi>New-England,</hi> from the first planting thereof by the English till the late Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Some few private Murthers there have been, which are not insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on in this <hi>Narrative,</hi> as namely those at <hi>Nantucket,</hi> and that by <hi>Matoonas</hi> his Son, and that at <hi>Woburn,</hi> but the publick peace was not so endangered by those clandestine Revenges, as by the Conspiracyes, the <hi>Relation</hi> whereof hath been described.</p>
            <p>It is easy to observe; from the <hi>History</hi> of these <hi>Troubles,</hi> that whereas there have been two sorts of men designing settlement in this part of <hi>America,</hi> some that came hither on the account of Trade, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interests, by whom the Indians have been scandalized, others that came hither on a Religious and conscientious account, having in their Eye, the Conversion of the <hi>Heathen</hi> unto Christ; the former have
<pb facs="tcp:47037:42"/> been attended with blasting ruining providences, these latter have bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> signally owned by the Lord Jesus; for the like hath been rarely known in the world, that a plantation should be raised out of nothing, and brought to such considerableness in so short a time, whereas in the close of the last <hi>Century,</hi> there was not so much as one Christian in this Land, there are now above <hi>Fourscore</hi> English, and <hi>Six</hi> Indian <hi>Churches</hi> therein, besides many other Congregations calling upon the Name of the True God in Jesus Christ, although as yet not brought into Church estate, according to the order of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi>
